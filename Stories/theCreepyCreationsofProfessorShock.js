DO NOT READ THIS 
BOOK FROM 
BEGINNING TO END! 

Clean out Professor Shock’s garage? Major drag! you say. Until you sneak 
into his workshop — and check out the gadgets. Whoa! He’s got a huge robot in 
there. And a really cool pinball machine. 

You’re dying to try them all. But look out. Some of the professor’s 
inventions do shocking things! Can you take it? Will you know what to do when 
an mp3 player attacks you? And what’s that thing labeled “Loreo”? Do you have 
the guts to find out? 

Whatever you do — don’t push the red button on that remote control! You 
already pushed it? Oops. Sorry! 

You’re in control of this scary adventure. You decide what will happen. And 
how terrifying the scares will be! 

Start on PAGE 1. Then follow the instructions at the bottom of each page. 
You make the choices. 

SO TAKE A DEEP BREATH, CROSS YOUR FINGERS, AND TURN TO 
PAGE 1 TO GIVE YOURSELF GOOSEBUMPS'.

“School’s out!” you yell gleefully. Leaning on the handlebars of your 
bicycle, you gaze at your best friends, Jason and Stacey. “What should we do 
today?” 

Jason and Stacey are twins. Both have blond hair and blue eyes. But that’s 
about the only way they’re alike. 

“Let’s ride around the park,” Jason suggests. 

“BOR-ing!” Stacey responds. “Let’s go someplace new.” 

As always, you make the decision. “We’ll go that way,” you say, pointing 
north out of the park. 

You race up the wide boulevard on your bicycles. Soon you’re in a part of 
town you’ve never seen before. 

“I heard this was the oldest part of the city,” Jason says. “Some of the houses 
go back to pioneer days.” 

“That one looks like it goes back to the dinosaurs,” you joke. You point at a 
high, crumbling brick wall. All you can see of the house behind it is a rotting 
roof. 

A sign by the front gate says please come in. 

You turn to your friends. “Let’s check it out,” you suggest. You turn back to 
the gate. 

And stop. In shock. Because the sign now says danger! 


Turn to PAGE 2.

You rub your eyes. Did you read the sign correctly? 

Then you see that it’s loose. It turns slowly in the wind — back to the side 
that says please come in. 

“Let’s go in!” Stacey says excitedly. 

“Are you nuts?” Jason cries. “The sign says danger.” 

As usual, you decide. “I want to see what’s inside,” you declare. The rusty 
gate is open a crack. You push it all the way open and enter. 

You find yourselves in a weedy yard with grass as high as your knees. 
Beyond the lawn stands a huge old three-story house. Paint peels from every 
wall. The porch sags. Several of the windows are boarded up. 

“It looks haunted,” Jason says nervously. 

Stacey rolls her eyes. “There’s no such thing,” she responds. “But I’ll bet no 
one’s lived here in a long time.” 

You step onto the sagging porch and peer in the front window. It’s so dirty 
you can’t see anything inside. 

Then a strong, bony hand clamps around your wrist. 


Go to PAGE 3.

Your heart thuds. A fierce-looking old man is holding your wrist. He’s 
totally bald. A bushy white beard hangs down to his chest. His dark eyes squint 
behind thick glasses. 

“It’s about time you got here! I’ve been waiting all morning. I’m Professor 
Shock,” the old man says. “Are you ready to start work?” 

“What do you mean?” you demand, pulling away from him. 

Professor Shock frowns. “Aren’t you from Acme Cleanup?” 

“No,” Stacey tells him. “We were riding around and saw your gate was 
open.” 

“Oh.” Professor Shock seems disappointed. “The people from Acme were 
supposed to clean my garage,” he explains. “But they didn’t show up. Why don’t 
I hire you kids? It’s not hard work — and I’ll pay you fifty dollars.” 

You glance at the twins. That’s a lot of money! 

Jason nods eagerly. “Sure! We’ll be glad to.” 

“Wonderful!” Professor Shock replies. “Right this way.” 

You follow the old man to the backyard. Then you see the garage. And you 
wonder if you’ve made a big mistake. 


Turn to PAGE 4.

The garage is as big as a barn — and packed with junk. Moldy old furniture. 
Rotting cardboard boxes. Piles of rags. A rusted-out car. And that’s just in the 
front part. 

“You want us to clean this out?” Stacey asks. 

“It’ll be easy!” Professor Shock says cheerily. He hands you brooms and 
trash bags. “I’ll check back later. Oh, one thing,” he adds. “Whatever you do, 
don’t go in the back room!” He points to a partially open green door at the back 
of the garage. 

“But —” Stacey cries. 

Too late. He’s gone. You and your friends gaze at the incredible mass of 
junk. Is the money really worth it? 

“Let’s get started,” you say with a sigh. 

You find a wheelbarrow and load piles of old newspapers into it. Stacey 
pushes a broom in the back of the garage. Jason carries boxes to the front. 

“Oh, no!” Stacey suddenly calls. “My ring slipped off my finger! And it 
rolled right into the back room!” 


Follow the ring to PAGE 33 .

“Be careful when we what?” you shout at the mirror. 

Professor Shock’s face in the mirror is fuzzy. And his voice is so faint you 
can barely hear it. You lean in and press your ear against the mirror. 

“When you enter the Queen’s chambers,” the professor croaks, “do not touch 
any of her things. If you do, you’ll be lost forever.” 

“But what about the mirror?” you demand. 

“Gaze into it,” the old man says. “It will tell you how —” 

ZZZT! His image flares for an instant. Then it’s gone — for good. 

But it doesn’t matter. You know what to do now! You hurry toward the 
twins. 


Hurry to PAGE 16 .

“Let’s work on the door,” you say to the twins. 

You glance around. Nothing in the basement but furniture. Well, your 
teachers always tell you to be creative.... 

You and Jason pick up a wooden coffee table. Holding it between you, you 
take off running and slam it against the door like a battering ram. WHAM! 

The door doesn’t budge. But the coffee table shatters! 

You grab a lamp and beat it against the door. Stacey joins you, bashing away 
with a metal statue. 

WHAM! WHAM! Beating on the door is a great way to let off steam. But, 
unfortunately, it doesn’t make the door open. You’re almost ready to give up. 

Then you hear a voice outside. 

“Stop that racket!” the voice cries. “I’m coming!” 

At last! Someone heard you! Now you can get out and try to stop the 
cyborgs. 

There’s a click as the lock pops. The door swings open. 

Your eyes widen. Look who’s standing outside! 


Take a peek on PAGE 38 .

You decide to try the green door. It swings open at a touch of your hand. You 
step through ... 

To another room of mirrors. But these mirrors are all small and square. They 
cover the walls, the ceiling, and the floor like tiles. You glance around for the 
door you stepped through. 

Uh-oh. 

There’s no sign of it. 

There’s no way out! 


Go to PAGE 62.

You decide to try fast forward. Maybe it’ll speed you up, so you can 
escape Professor Shock’s robot! 

You jab your finger down on the fast forward button. 

Every single machine in the workshop clicks on at once. And they all run at 
supersonic speeds! Lights flicker on and off like strobes. The computer printer 
spews out paper, hundreds of pages a minute. The power drill spins so fast it 
starts to smoke. The pinball machine flashes and clangs. 

And then everything stops. Just like that. 

“What happened?” you demand. Your voice sounds strangely tinny. You 
reach up to touch your mouth. 

CLANG! Hey! Your skin feels ... metallic. 

“Congratulations,” Professor Shock says. 

You glance at him. And gasp. He’s turned silver! Light gleams off his 
polished head. 

He’s become a robot! 

And so have you! 

“You fast-forwarded right through all the stages,” Professor Shock tells you. 
“My plan is now complete. Thank you!” 

Welcome to Machine World. 

Hope you like heavy metal music! 


THE END

“We’d better go after our reflections,” you say. “What if they don’t come 
back? We can’t go through life without them. We’ve got to catch up!” 

You thrust your foot at the mirror. It slides right through! A tingle runs up 
your leg. 

And then you’re on the other side. 

Stacey and Jason pop through a moment later. The three of you are right in 
front of Miller’s Ice Cream. The sun is shining. The air is full of familiar scents 
and sounds. 

“We are home,” Jason says. “This is great!” 

You point to the plate-glass store window. Everything is reflected there — 
everything but the three of you. It’s very creepy. 

“We have to get our reflections back,” you say firmly. “Come on. They must 
be in the store.” 

But when you enter the ice-cream store, there’s no one there but the cashier. 
A white ceiling fan circles lazily. 

Stacey steps up to the cashier. “Excuse me,” she says. “Did three kids just 
mn in here? Three kids who look a lot like us?” 

Jason nudges you. “There they are,” he whispers, pointing to a big mirror on 
the right-hand wall. 

You run over and peer into the mirror. “HEY!” you shout. 


What’s all the shouting about? Find out on PAGE 67 .

“Okay, let’s go get Uncle Jack,” you tell Stacey and Jason. “I guess we’ll 
just leave Professor Shock here for now.” 

You run back into the mall and pelt down the stairs to the storage basement. 
The door is held closed by a thick padlock. But strangely, it’s not locked. Jason 
pulls off the padlock and Uncle Jack steps out. 

“Red built a monster robot!” you blurt. “And Professor Shock is taking a nap 
in the middle of the parking lot!” 

“You don’t say,” Uncle Jack remarks. 

You stare at him. How can he sound so calm? Doesn’t he understand what’s 
happening? 

Uncle Jack smiles at Jason. “So you managed to give the professor the nerve 
pinch and put him to sleep. Excellent! Our plan is working perfectly,” he tells 
them. 

You feel a sudden chill. 

“What plan?” you ask slowly. 


Get the details on PAGE 19.

You decide to show the remote to your friends. Why not? You can return it 
to Professor Shock tomorrow. You stuff the rest of your cookies into your pocket 
for later. Then you bike over to Jason and Stacey’s house. 

The twins are on their back porch, where Jason is building a model plane. 
You tell them about Professor Shock’s gadget. 

“You mean it can turn any machine on?” Stacey asks. 

“No way,” Jason sneers. “No remote works on everything.” 

Jason needs some convincing. You point the remote at his half-made model 
plane and press one of the black buttons. 

The model plane soars into the air! 

“Hey!” Jason cries. “How did you do that? That plane doesn’t even have a 
motor!” 

You find that you can control the plane’s motion by holding down the 
button. So you make the plane turn. Dip. Roll. 

“Cool!” Jason declares. He’s convinced. 

Then the plane suddenly turns in the air. By itself. 

And dives straight at you and the twins! 


Go on to PAGE 1 7.

You squeeze through a narrow opening between two tall mirrors. It leads 
into an entrance hall. You and the twins walk in — and stop, shocked. 

The inside of the Palace is made of mirrors, too! Everywhere you look, 
hundreds of reflections of yourself gaze back at you. 

“What a strange place!” Stacey exclaims. 

“I never saw so many mirrors,” Jason says. “One of these must be the one 
we’re looking for.” 

“No way!” Stacey disagrees. “They wouldn’t keep the Queen’s mirror in 
some lousy entrance hall! It must be in another part of the Palace. I bet it has its 
own special room.” 

“We should search in here first,” Jason insists. 

“It’s a waste of time,” Stacey retorts. 

You sigh. Sometimes you feel like a referee. 

“I’ll tell you what we’re going to do,” you say. 


If you stay and search for the Queen’s mirror in the entrance hall, go to 
PAGE 49 . 

If you skip the entrance hall and search the rest of the Palace, turn to PAGE 16.

A tiny beetle clings to a branch of an enormous tree. It has a gigantic, 
trumpet-shaped mouth. 

“AROOOOOOO! ” the beetle booms. 

“A bug?” Jason says in disbelief. 

You step up, peering at the little insect. 

“AROOOOO!” it shouts. 

Your head vibrates like a gong. 

“Why aren’t you three in school?” a stern voice demands. You glance up to 
see a big man wearing a badge. 

“A policeman!” Stacey cries. “Officer, can you help us find the Palace of 
Mirrors?” 

“The Palace is across the lake,” the policeman replies. “But you can’t go 
there now. You kids are supposed to be in school!” 

Behind the policeman you can glimpse a wide lake through the trees. 
Something glitters on the far shore. Is it the Palace? 

“Come on,” the officer says. “I’ll take you to school.” 

You hesitate. Is it worth trying to explain your problem to the policeman? If 
he believes you, he might help you. But your story is pretty weird. Maybe you’re 
better off running away and trying to get to the Palace of Mirrors on your own. 


If you try to get help from the policeman, turn to PAGE 44 . 
If you run for the Palace instead, go to PAGE 121 .

You decide to give the backward answer. 

“Seven and eight are fifty-one,” you tell the teacher. 

“Wrong!” Ms. Silver cries in triumph. “Everyone knows that seven and eight 
make fifteen!” 

“But —” you start to protest. 

“Arnie gave a correct answer, but you told him he was wrong!” Stacey yells. 

“Yeah! You can’t have it both ways,” Jason adds. 

“Silence!” Ms. Silver screams. “I will not tolerate back talk. Into the closet. 
All three of you!” 

Before you can move, the teacher has your ear in an iron grip. Out of the 
corner of your eye, you see that she’s got Jason’s and Stacey’s ears pinched 
together in her other hand. You struggle, but you’re no match for Ms. Silver. 

“Give my regards to the sharks,” she sneers. Then she shoves you all 
through the closet door and slams it. 

It’s pitch-dark inside. You seem to be sitting in a giant woven basket of some 
sort. Straw pokes into your back. 

“Did she say sharks?” Jason moans. 

You never get the chance to answer. Because suddenly there’s a deafening 
SPRRROINGGGG! Like a giant rubber band snapping. 

And then the three of you are hurtling through the air! 


Hurtle on to PAGE 85.

You decide to try the white switch. You love pinball! “Who wants to 
challenge the pinball wizard?” you call and flip the switch. 

Nothing happens. The machine doesn’t light up. There’s no noise. No 
flashing lights, no KA-CHING! Nothing. 

“I don’t believe it!” you grumble, smacking the machine. You’re about to hit 
it again when you see movement out of the corner of your eye. The green door! 
It’s opening! 

Professor Shock! You can’t let him find you here! 

“Back here!” Stacey whispers. She pulls you and Jason behind the pinball 
machine. You squeeze in between the machine and an old, dusty mirror lying 
against the wall. 

Your elbow knocks against the mirror. Suddenly, lights begin to flash. Sirens 
go off. The mirror begins to vibrate. 

Horrified, you run your hands over the mirror’s frame. How can you turn the 
thing off? 

But soon you stop worrying about that. You’ve got bigger problems. 

A weird, invisible force is sucking you into the mirror! 


Turn to PAGE 63.

“Stacey’s right. We’re not going to find the mirror here in the entrance hall,” 
you announce. 

“Hah!” Stacey looks triumphant. “Let’s go this way!” 

She hurries out of the mirrored entrance hall and down a dark, chilly 
corridor. Jason’s right beside her, still arguing. You move fast, trying to keep up. 

After a few moments you notice that the floor slants downward. The twins 
are several yards ahead of you. Putting on a burst of speed, you catch up with 
them. 

“Guess what?” you begin. 

“Who cares?” Jason grumbles. “All I want is to get —” 

“Look!” Stacey interrupts. With a gasp, she stops walking. You peek past her 
shoulder. Then you stop and stare. You have never seen anything like this in your 
life! 


Flip to PAGE 131 .

The plane is aiming straight for your head. Eek! You stab your finger at the 
remote button that controls the plane. 

The plane merely picks up speed! 

“Duck!” you yell. You and the twins dive off the porch. 

KAA-RUNCH! The model plane slams into the side of the house. It’s 
completely wrecked. 

Jason turns to you angrily. “Why did you do that?” 

“I didn’t,” you protest. “Really! It wasn’t me. It was the remote. I think 
maybe it has a short circuit.” 

“You mean you broke it?” Jason shakes his head. “Professor Shock is going 
to be really mad.” 

“Hey, I know!” Stacey breaks in. “Our uncle Jack has an electronics repair 
shop in the old mall. I bet he can fix it.” 

“The old mall?” you repeat, a little nervously. 

You’re not supposed to go there. After the new mall opened, most of the 
stores in the old mall went out of business. The whole building is going to be 
torn down next month. It’s a dangerous, deserted place. 

Still, you’d really like to get the remote checked out before you return it to 
Professor Shock.... 

“Let’s go,” you say, and climb back on your bike. 


Cycle to PAGE 39 .

This is the easiest decision you’ve made all day. 

Obviously, you’re going to ram Stacey. She’s much more fun to play bumper 
cars with than Jason! 

You set the remote down on the dashboard. “Heads up!” you yell and steer 
straight at Stacey’s blue car. 

A huge grin spreads across her face. “You asked for it,” she shouts. 

Hunching over the steering wheel, she speeds toward you. 

WHAM! You slam into each other, head on. Stacey’s car bounces back and 
spins out of control. The impact makes your little car rock. 

And the remote goes flying off the dashboard. 

Your jaw drops. Time seems to slow down as the remote spins through the 
air, end over end. All you can do is stare in horror. 


Pick your jaw up off the floor and turn to PAGE 37 .

Stacey puts a hand on your shoulder. “Remember how Uncle Jack told you 
he built Red’s circuits?” she asks you. 

You don’t like the way she’s looking at you. “So what?” you say and shrug 
her hand away. 

Jason puts a hand on your other shoulder. “Well, that wasn’t quite true,” he 
tells you. “Actually, it’s the other way around. Uncle Red’s the one who built 
Uncle Jack.” 

Uncle Red? 

Stacey smiles. “And then Uncle Jack built Jason and me!” 

You’re suddenly having trouble breathing. “You mean —” 

“Yes.” Jason nods. “We’re cyborgs.” 

“We used you to steal the remote from Professor Shock. We knew he’d come 
after it,” Uncle Jack explains. “We had to get him somewhere, away from all his 
gadgets, where we could neutralize him. You see, he’s the only person who could 
have stopped us.” 

Your legs start to shake. You need to sit down. “You mean all this time, I’ve 
been hanging out with cyborgs?” you squeak. “Helping them?” 

“Right,” Jason says. “As a reward, we’re willing to make you one of us. Isn’t 
that great?” 

You? A cyborg? A mutant machine monster? 

If you can’t beat them, join them. After all, they won, in 


THE END. 


20 

Slowly, nervously, you and the twins step out of the elevator. The doors 
swish closed behind you. 

You’re in a huge room. Steps lead down to a polished white floor. Staring 
around in wonder, you walk down them. 

Giant red numbers are painted all over the floor, which slopes gently 
downward. Thick blue and yellow pillars sprout up everywhere. Here and there 
you see what look like archery targets, outlined in neon light. Odd, wedge- 
shaped swinging gates are also scattered around the room. 

“Where are we?” Jason whispers. 

“It looks like a fun house!” Stacey exclaims. 

You glance up. Hey! The ceiling is made of glass! Through it, you can 
glimpse an even bigger room — so vast you can’t take it all in. 

Then, you spot something else. Something unbelievable. Something so 
terrifying you can’t hold back a scream. 


AAAAAAAAGHHH! Turn to PAGE 23! 




21 


You and the twins dash through the mall, past the abandoned Kiddie 
Karnival. You find the emergency fire station at the far end of the first level. But 
the hose is locked behind glass! 

“Stand back!” Stacey shouts. Grabbing a loose tile from the floor, she heaves 
it at the glass. It shatters. 

You seize the canvas fire hose and race back the way you came. “Turn on the 
water!” you shout over your shoulder. 

You reach the parking lot just in time. The monster robot is after Professor 
Shock! It rolls after him, whacking at him with its giant bulldozer-shovel hands. 
Behind it, Red works the buttons on the remote control, laughing like a maniac. 

The professor staggers around the parking lot, trying desperately to stay 
clear of the deadly shovels. He looks exhausted. You know he can’t keep 
running much longer. 

Jason and Stacey come up behind you. “Oh, no! Poor Professor,” Stacey 
gasps. 

“Hurry!” Professor Shock pants. “Turn the hose on the robot. Try to short- 
circuit it!” 

The hose is too hard to hold alone. Jason and Stacey grab on with you. The 
three of you aim the water at the giant machine. 

Will the professor’s plan work? 


Who knows ? Turn to PAGE 129. 



22 

In big, black letters, the sign says: 

JUNKYARD 

Huh? Isn’t that where people throw away old dishwashers and other 
appliances? Why would the bicycle bring you here? 

The bike tears through the gate. Straight toward an enormous junk heap! 

You squint. It’s hard to see, with the wind in your eyes, but it appears as if 
the junk heap is moving. Ugh! you think. It must be covered with rats or 
something! 

Without warning, the bike screeches to a stop. 

You, however, keep going. 

You sail over the handlebars and fly toward the junk heap. Now, at last, you 
can see it clearly. 

It’s a squirming, heaving pile of ... people! 

That’s right. In this horrible machine world, human beings are useless. 
Garbage. 

Your bike was simply taking out the trash! 


THE END 



23 


“AAAAAAGHHH!” you scream. 

A mountain-sized man is peering through the ceiling at you! 

He has a long, white beard. Every hair of it is like a thick rope. The wrinkles 
on his face are so deep that you could get lost forever if you fell into one of 
them. Thick, black-framed glasses make his tremendous eyes look even more 
huge. 

Wait a second! You recognize this giant! It’s ... 

“Professor Shock!” Stacey shrieks. 

“Ooohh ...” Jason murmurs. And faints. 

Your heart races. What’s going on? Where are you? And how on earth did 
Professor Shock get to be so big? 

The professor strokes his beard with his enormous hand. Then he reaches 
down. His hand disappears somewhere to the right of the glass-ceilinged room. 

CLING! GA-ZURK! SPROINGGGGG! 

You feel a chill. There’s something horribly familiar about those clanging 
noises.... 


What’s Professor Shock up to? Turn to PAGE 74 and see. 



24 

Stacey has grown! Her arms and legs are like pudgy balloons. But her head 
has shrunk to the size of an apple! 

“What’s wrong with you?” you gasp. 

“With me?” Stacey demands. Her voice is high and squeaky. She sounds like 
a talking gerbil. “I was about to ask you the same thing! Your head looks like a 
balloon!” 

“You both look like weirdos!” Jason screams. 

You glance at him. Then you stare at him. He’s become tall and skinny. 
Really, really skinny. His whole body is no thicker around than a broomstick. 

His arms and legs are like pieces of spaghetti. His eyes are two tiny dots in his 
long, thin head. 

You can’t help laughing. The twins look so weird! But your laugh booms out 
as if it’s coming through a megaphone. You reach up and touch your face. 

You could fit a basketball in your mouth! It’s huge! And your head is simply 
enormous! 

It’s all too clear what happened. Going through the fun house mirror has 
somehow changed your bodies. Now you look like your fun house reflections! 

At that moment a bank of lights flashes on, blinding you. 


Blink and turn to PAGE 94. 




25 


The hideous Queen marches you to a mirrored, revolving door at the end of 
the room. 

“Ow!” you exclaim. Her bony fingers are biting into your flesh! 

The Queen positions you in front of the revolving door. Then she gives you a 
hard shove in the back. You stumble forward. 

“Whoa!” you shout as you whirl around and around. 

When the door finally stops revolving, you’re completely dizzy. You take a 
few weaving steps and then raise your head and gaze around. 

Wow! You’re in a hall of mirrors! Everywhere you turn, you see reflections 
of yourself. You frown. Your hair looks messy. 

No time to worry about that, though. You’ve got to get out of here and keep 
searching for the Queen’s mirror. 

Now, where was that revolving door? You turn to the left. 

Your face smiles back at you. 

You go right. 

There you are again. 

Your heart thuds as you realize: You have no idea where the revolving door 
is. Among all these mirrors, it could take you years to find it again. You’re stuck. 
In a hall of mirrors. 

And the worst part is, you’re having a bad hair day! 


THE END 


26 

“I’m sorry,” you tell Professor Shock. “We didn’t mean to come in here. And 
we didn’t mean to make the robot go nuts. It was all an accident!” 

“What about the damage?” the old man thunders. “You’ve caused thousands 
of dollars worth of damage!” 

You gulp. “I’ll work to help pay for it,” you offer. 

“You’ll pay, all right,” Professor Shock mutters. He glances around. 

“Where’s my remote control? I left it on my desk.” 

“You mean this?” Guiltily, you pull the two pieces of the flat, black box from 
your pocket. 

“You broke it!” the professor screams. “What will I do now?” Then his eyes 
narrow thoughtfully. “Never mind. I just figured out what you can do to pay me 
back. Follow me.” 

Nervously, you follow the old man out of the garage and into his house. As 
soon as he opens the door, loud squawks fill your ears. 

“In here,” Professor Shock shouts above the noise. 

You stop and stare. The living room is even stranger than the garage. 


See why on PAGE 72 . 




27 


Screaming, you and the twins plunge downward. 

THUMP! You land on something soft. You sit up and feel your arms and 
legs. Nothing broken. That’s a relief! 

Faint light streams in from a window high above your head. You see that 
you’ve landed on a big couch. All around you are other couches, and chairs, and 
beds. All are covered with dust. 

“Oh,” someone groans. It’s Stacey! She landed in one of the armchairs. “My 
ankle hurts,” she complains, rubbing it. 

Across from you, Jason sits up in the middle of a king-sized bed. “Where are 
we?” he asks in a dazed voice. 

“I think we’re in the storage basement for one of the mall furniture stores,” 
you say slowly. 

You scramble to your feet and make your way to the door at one end of the 
basement. Locked. Of course. You pound on it. “Help!” you call. “Let us out of 
here!” But no one answers. 

The window is too high to reach. Hmm. Looks as if you’ll have to wait until 
someone comes down here. 

Someone will find us soon, you think. They have to move the furniture 
before they tear down the mall. You’ll be all right. 

Then you hear a hideous moan. 


See who — or what — is moaning on PAGE 41 . 



28 

The twins are arguing loudly. It’s giving you a headache! All you want to do 
is go home. 

“I’m going to try the mirror,” you call over their voices. Briskly, you thrust 
your foot through the glass. 

CRACK! CRASH! SMASH! TINKLE! The mirror shatters. 

Whoops! Well, at least you stopped the twins’ squabbling. 

“Nice move!” Stacey laughs. 

“It’s bad luck to break a mirror,” Jason adds. 

Tiny bits of glass rain all around you. They land on your clothes ... your 
hair.... You try to brush them away. 

But they seem to be stuck. All over you. 

“Help!” Jason cries. “I’m covered with glass!” 

Pieces of mirror swirl around the three of you. The ones that land on the 
floor jump up and clump together. 

“Hey!” Stacey shrieks, pointing. “Two pieces of glass just turned into one!” 

In shock, you realize that the bits of mirror are rejoining themselves around 
you and the twins. Trapping you inside! 

Then you notice something else. Something worse.

That yell sounded like Jason! You and Stacey dash after him into the back 
room. 

He’s struggling in the grip of a tall, red-haired man with a beard. You stare. 
This guy is almost as big as Deep Voice! 

“Leave my brother alone!” Stacey yells. 

“What have you done with Uncle Jack?” Jason cries at the same time. 

The red-haired man lets Jason go. “Sorry, kid,” he says. “I thought you were 
trying to steal something. Jack’s your uncle, huh? My name’s Red. I — uh — 
bought this shop from him.” 

Jason scowls. “Why didn’t Uncle Jack tell us about you?” 

Red shrugs. “Maybe he forgot.” 

You’re in a hurry to leave this creepy mall before Deep Voice catches up to 
you. “Come on,” you say to your friends. 

“Wait!” Red cries. “I didn’t mean to upset you kids. Tell you what. Let me 
see your remote. I’ll fix it for free.” 

You stare at him. You never mentioned the remote to him! How does he 
know you have it? 

Oh, no! Is he after Professor Shock’s gadget, too? 


Turn to PAGE 61.

You decide your best chance is to do as the Queen ordered. So you rub the 
carving of the turtles until it’s shiny and green. Sadly, you set it aside and 
continue with your work. 

A few minutes later, you glance at the pile of carvings. Hey! It’s only half as 
big as it was before! 

Afterward, you’re never sure if you really polished all those stone carvings 
yourself or if some hidden force helped you. All you know is, by the end of the 
second hour, every single one of the carvings has been buffed until it glows. 

You’re hanging up the last one when the Queen returns. 

“NO!” she screams. “THIS IS ALL WRONG! You did it! You polished all 
the carvings! Nobody’s ever done that before!” 

Is she going back on your deal? The idea makes you so mad you forget to be 
scared. “Well, I did,” you declare. “And we made an agreement.” 

“I know, I know,” the Queen grumbles. She sighs. “All right, I’ll stick to it. 
First, your friends.” She stabs a finger at the ceiling. The carving of the turtles 
begins to glow green. 

POP! A moment later Stacey and Jason stand beside you. You stare at them 
and rub your eyes. You can barely recognize them! 

What has happened to your friends? 


Ask them on PAGE 79. 




31 


You snatch the remote off your bed and punch frantically at the buttons. 

Your finger lands on one of the black buttons. 

A second later, the awful, blasting music stops. 

Silence! You never knew how great it was! 

For a while you simply sit there, shaking. Then you examine the player. It 
looks the same as it always did. 

You peer at the remote. That green ray that came out of it. Did it really make 
your player go crazy? 

You cross to the other side of the room and point the remote at the player. 
Cautiously, you press the button that seemed to turn the player off. 

No green ray. But the player blares on instantly. The music is so loud that 
you can hear it clear over on the other side of the room. Even though it’s coming 
through the headphones! 

Quickly, you press the button again. The music shuts off. 

You examine the remote more closely. What are all those buttons for? 
Especially that red one ... 

Do you dare to find out? 


Sure you do. Press the red button on PAGE 91 . 



32 

“Find the what?” you shout. But it’s too late. The professor is gone. 

The roaring wind stops. You land sprawling on a slick, hard floor. The twins 
plop down beside you. 

“What happened?” Jason cries. “Where are we?” 

You gaze around. The room you’re in has no doors or windows. The only 
decorations on the gray walls are two built-in mirrors. 

“We came through the mirror,” you say slowly. You’re trying to stay calm. 

“That’s impossible,” Stacey objects. 

“Look around,” you order. “There’s no other way in.” 

“And no way out!” Jason wails. 

The three of you stare at each other. Impossible as it seems, you’re inside the 
mirror. 

And you’re trapped. 


Flip to PAGE 59 . 


33 

You and Jason hurry to the back of the garage. You glance toward the front. 
No sign of Professor Shock. 

“Come on,” you say. “Let’s find the ring.” 

But when you step through the green door, you forget all about Stacey’s ring. 
The room is packed with electronic gadgets and toys! Every shelf and table 
holds a cool-looking machine. Lights flash. Circuits buzz. A blackboard is 
covered with mathematical formulas. The walls are plastered with diagrams of 
machines. 

“I bet Professor Shock is an inventor!” Stacey exclaims. “This must be his 
workshop!” 

“What do all these things do?” Jason wonders. 

You’re studying two huge switches on the back wall. One’s red. One’s white. 
From the red switch, a red wire leads to the back of an eight-foot-tall copper 
robot. A white cable from the white switch leads to a high-tech pinball machine. 
It looks like the coolest game you’ve ever seen. 

You already know you’re going to pull one of the switches. The only 
question is — which switch? 


Pull the red switch to the robot on PAGE 35. 


Try the white switch to the pinball machine on PAGE 15 . 




34 

Then you slap your forehead. Of course! The answer is so simple you’re 
embarrassed it took you this long to think of it. You know how to escape the 
vines and find the sign to the Palace! 

“Walk backward!” you tell the twins. 

As fast as you can, you shuffle backward. The orange vine immediately 
starts unwinding. You breathe a sigh of relief. 

It’s hard to move through the thick vines and trees. Shoots and stems grab at 
your legs and arms. But you keep going. And, as you suspected, the path quickly 
clears. 

In a few moments you arrive at a familiar fork. Ahead of you are two signs. 
One says loreo. The other says palace of mirrors. 

“Let’s take the path to the Palace this time,” Jason says. 

You nod. It’s got to be better than the path you just tried! 


Turn to PAGE 109. 




35 


You decide to try the red switch. You reach up behind the giant robot and 
flip the switch to on. 

At first nothing happens. But then the robot’s eyes blink open. Red pinpoints 
of light shine out of them. It swivels its head. Left. Right. Left. Right. 

“Whoa. Excellent!” Stacey exclaims. 

“It looks dangerous,” Jason complains. 

You think the robot is the coolest thing you’ve seen in a long time. “Maybe 
we can make it clean up the garage!” you suggest. 

You aren’t sure how to control the robot. You try pushing it toward the green 
door. The metal man’s arms wave clumsily in the air. Then it takes a jerky step 
forward. 

“This is great!” Stacey says. 

Even Jason agrees, for once. “We won’t have to do any work at all now!” He 
whacks the robot enthusiastically on its copper back as it lumbers by him. “Go to 
it, pal.” 

The robot blinks. Gears whir. 

Then it spins around and grabs for Jason’s throat. 

“Help! It’s gone crazy!” Jason shouts. “Stop it!” 


Hurry to PAGE 86 . 



36 

“Wh-who’s there?” you stammer. 

“Never mind that. Just give me the professor’s remote control,” the deep 
voice growls. 

The remote? 

How does Deep Voice know about Professor Shock’s gadget? Did he follow 
you to the mall? Your mind races. You don’t know! 

But you do know you can’t give up the remote. If Deep Voice wants it so 
badly, it must be even more powerful than you thought. You’ve got to get it back 
to Professor Shock! 

“Yaaah!” you shout and shove your bike backward. 

CRASH! CLANG! BANG! 

“OWWW!” Deep Voice bellows. 

“Grab hands and run!” you order the twins. 

Holding hands, the three of you stumble forward. You can tell by his heavy 
footsteps that Deep Voice is close behind you. 

Then, dead ahead, doors suddenly swish open to reveal a small, lighted, 
wood-paneled room. 

An elevator! 

No time to wonder how it knew you were coming. You dash in. The doors 
close. The elevator starts to rise. 

A moment later, an alarm bell rings. The lights go out. And the elevator 
lurches to a stop. 


Turn to PAGE 89. 




37 


The remote tumbles down. Hits the floor. Bounces once. And then — 

CR UNCCCCCHHHHH! 

Stacey’s blue car rolls over it. And flattens it. 

“Oh, no ...” you groan. 

“NO!” someone else screams. Someone with a deep, hollow voice. 

You glance up. Red and Deep Voice are both standing by the edge of the 
bumper car ring, staring in horror. 

“You rotten kids!” Red bellows. “You broke the remote. You ruined all our 
plans!” 

That’s a plus. You still don’t know what Red and Deep Voice were up to, but 
you’re sure it was no good. So you’re glad that you stopped them. 

But on the minus side, now that the remote is broken, you have no way to 
turn off the bumper cars. 

In fact, you’re stuck. As the little cars zoom around and around the ring, you 
realize that they’re going way too fast for you to risk jumping out. 

Good thing you like bumper cars. Because you’re going to be bumping 
around in this one for a long, long time! 


THE END 

38 

“What’s all the fuss?” a metallic voice grumbles. 

It’s Professor Shock’s robot! And it can talk! Professor Shock is the most 
brilliant inventor ever, you think. 

Uncle Jack pushes past you. “Where’s Professor Shock?” he demands. “We 
need to see him right away. We must join forces.” 

“No need,” the robot answers. “The battle is already over.” 

“The battle?” you gasp. “What battle?” 

The robot turns its red eyes on you. “The battle between the humans and the 
cyborgs,” it answers. “We won.” 

“We won!” Stacey cries, clapping her hands. “Did you hear? We won! That’s 
great news!” 

You’re not so sure. “Uh, by the way ... which side are you on?” you ask the 
robot, trying to sound casual. 

“The side of the machines, of course,” the robot replies. “Our age is just 
beginning. Now, follow me ... slaves!” 

The Machine Age may be just beginning. But for you humans, this is 
definitely 


THE END. 



39 


You, Jason, and Stacey ride out to the old mall on the edge of town. As you 
draw near, you begin to wonder if this was such a good idea. The mall looks 
even worse than you remembered! Weeds sprout from cracks in the pavement. 
Several of the windows are boarded up. 

“Why is your uncle’s store here?” you ask the twins. 

“He’s trying to sell it and retire,” Jason tells you. “But no one wants to buy 
it. So he’s kind of stuck.” 

“Uncle Jack’s store is on the third level,” Stacey calls over her shoulder. 
“Let’s cut through the garage.” She veers down the driveway into the lower level 
of the parking garage. 

You and Jason follow. Privately, you wish she’d gone around the garage. 
Sometimes you wish Stacey wasn’t so fearless. 

Like now. It’s pitch-dark in the garage. So dark that you have to climb off 
your bike. You can’t ride if you can’t see where you’re going! 

Are Stacey and Jason still with you? “Guys?” you call. 

“Here!” Stacey calls. Her voice comes from your left. 

“Over here.” That’s Jason. On your right. 

“Behind you,” a deep voice says in your ear. 

Yikes! Who’s that ? 


Shh! Tiptoe to PAGE 36 . 




40 


“What are you kids doing?” Professor Shock demands. Dashing to the red 
switch, he turns it to off. A grinding sound, like a dying car engine, comes from 
the robot. Slowly its arms stop swinging. Its legs stop churning. Its head falls 
forward and clangs against its copper chest. 

An awful silence falls over the room. 

You gaze around at the horrible mess. The flat, black box from the desk is 
lying in two pieces at your feet. Trying not to draw attention to yourself, you 
pick them up and stuff them in your pocket. Maybe you can fix the box later. 

Professor Shock steps toward you. His face is red with anger. “I thought I 
told you not to come in here!” he growls. 

“Let’s go!” Stacey cries. She and Jason bolt out the door. 

You really want to follow them. But maybe you ought to apologize instead 
and offer to help clean things up. 

What will it be? 


Follow your friends out the door on PAGE 54 . 
Apologize and offer to help on PAGE 26 . 





41 


“D-did you hear that?” Jason asks, his voice shaking. 

The moan swells again. Louder. 

“There’s someone else here!” Stacey cries. 

Who? Where? You glance around the shadowy basement. 

“It came from over there,” Stacey whispers, pointing toward the corner 
nearest the door. “Come on — we have to investigate!” 

You and the twins cautiously approach the corner. 

Then you spot two legs. Sticking out from under a bed. 

You and the twins stare at one another. Who’s under there? Nervously, you 
bend down and tug on the legs. 

A man slides out from under the bed. His hands are bound behind him. A 
gag is tied tightly over his mouth. 

Stacey gasps. 

“Uncle Jack!” she cries. 


Flip to PAGE 51 . 



42 

“I agree with Jason,” you announce. “Let’s wait here for our reflections. 
They have to come back.” 

You hope! 

Your words were brave enough. But the empty mirror is giving you major 
creeps. Shivering, you turn your back to it. “I mean, who ever heard of a 
reflection that could exist on its own?” you go on. “Right, guys?” 

There’s no answer. 

“Guys?” you repeat. 

“Uh ...” Stacey’s voice is very faint. When you glance at her, her eyes are 
like two saucers. She’s staring at the mirror. 

You spin around. 

Yikes! 


Turn to PAGE 58. 




43 


The copper robot lurches toward you. It’s going to take the Universal 
Remote and give it to Professor Shock. Who is definitely, completely, 
unquestionably ... crazy! 

You can’t let him have the gadget. “No way!” you shout, and dodge behind 
the desk. The robot clanks after you. 

“Why make a fuss?” Professor Shock wants to know. “It’ll be nice when the 
world is mechanical. Machines are clean. They work hard. They never ask for 
days off. They’re much better than humans! Don’t fight me. Give up the 
remote.” 

The robot backs you into a corner. There’s no way out. Desperately, you aim 
the remote at the robot and punch some of the black buttons. A few of the shop 
machines whir on. 

But the robot pays no attention. It keeps coming after you. 

You clutch the remote. You won’t give it up without a fight! 

Then you have an idea. 

There are two buttons on the remote that you haven X pushed yet. rewind and 
fast forward. They might not do anything useful. 

On the other hand, what do you have to lose? 

Go ahead. Press one! 


If you press rewind, turn to PAGE 100 . 

If you press fast forward, go to PAGE 8 .

You decide to try to talk to the policeman. “Officer, it’s like this. We aren’t 
really from this world —” you begin. 

The policeman snorts. “Button it, kid. I don’t want to hear your tall tales.” 
He hustles you and the twins toward the lake. 

You don’t argue. The lake is where you want to go anyway. 

The policeman shoves you into a rowboat and then rows to a small island 
just offshore. On the island is a red schoolhouse with a bell on the roof. “Last 
stop,” he tells you. “Go on in. And don’t let me catch you playing hooky again!” 

“But —” Jason tries to say. 

The policeman raises his hand. “Get going!” 

You and the twins walk through the door into a classroom. Several students 
sit at desks. In front of a blackboard stands a scowling woman in an old- 
fashioned long dress. 

“Welcome, new students. I’m Ms. Silver,” she says. 

“Actually, we don’t belong here,” you say. “We’re —” 

“Of course you belong here,” Ms. Silver interrupts. “All children belong in 
school.” 

“But —” 

“Silence!” she orders. “Take seats in the back row and prepare for a quiz.” 


Go on to PAGE 56.

“I’ll stay on the bike,” you decide. The thing is traveling along a definite 
route, almost as if it’s been preprogrammed. Which is pretty creepy. You figure 
you should stick around and find out where it’s going. And why. 

The bike zooms down a hill. Faster. Faster! Before long, it’s moving so fast 
the wheels start to give off a high-pitched noise. Almost like a scream. 

You clutch the handlebars and hunch down. Wind drags at your hair. Your 
clothes. It’s all you can do to stay on the seat. 

You’re really scared now. But it’s too late to jump off. At this speed, you’d 
splat on the pavement like a broken egg! 

The bike turns left at a white signboard and then races toward a high, 
barbed-wire fence. There’s a gate dead ahead. It’s open. 

As you whiz past the white sign, you manage to glimpse what it says. 

Uh-oh! 


What does the sign say? Read it on PAGE 22 . 



46 

“You’re right!” you call to Stacey. “Split up!” 

Stacey veers off to the right. Jason turns to the left. You keep racing straight 
ahead. 

You glance back. The bull is after you! He’s so close that you can feel his 
hot breath on the backs of your legs. His hoofs thunder louder.... And louder ... 

It looks like the end for you. At least Stacey and Jason are safe, you think. 
Until Jason streaks past on your left. 

Ahull just like the one behind you is hot on his heels! 

Hearing a scream, you glance to the right. 

A third identical bull is chasing Stacey. 

Somehow, the bull has split into three! And all three mad bulls are after you 
and your friends. 

Too bad! Splitting up seemed like a good idea. But now you’re going to be 
split for real — by the bull! 


THE END 



47 


You’re fascinated by the mirror showing the country scene. “Let’s try this 
one,” you say. “If we don’t like what we find, we can always come back.” 

The twins agree. Trying not to feel silly, you poke your left foot at the glass. 

Hey! It goes right through! The glass feels rubbery. It’s like walking through 
a bowl of Jell-O. Your arms and legs tingle. 

And then you’re on the other side. 

You glance around. You’re in a flower-dotted field. Jason and Stacey are 
beside you. Warm sun pours down. Birds are singing. In the distance, cows 
munch on grass. 

But there’s something wrong with the whole scene.... 

“The grass! It’s blue!” Jason cries. “And the sky’s green!” 

He’s right! And now that you know what to look for, you notice that the 
cows are red and yellow, while the flowers are spotted black and white. The 
colors are reversed. Backward! 

“Where are we?” Stacey cries. 

“Who cares?” Jason says. “I want to go back.” He turns around. Then he 
gasps. 

“The mirror!” he shouts. “Where’s the mirror?” 


Go to PAGE 60. 



48 

“Heads up!” you yell as the bike carries you away. 

It races down your walk and into the street. Straight for a speeding bus! 

You jam on the brakes. Nothing happens. 

You try to swerve to the left. But you can’t control the handlebars. They turn 
themselves to the right. The bus’s radiator looms in front of you. You stare, 
frozen in terror. 

Then you scrape past the bus. With only inches to spare. 

Whew! 

The bike darts in and out of traffic. It’s nerve-wracking, but there’s nothing 
you can do to control it. So you hang on and try to ignore the danger while you 
figure out what’s going on. 

Could this mechanical madness have anything to do with Professor Shock’s 
remote control? When you pressed that red button, did something happen after 
all? 

You suddenly notice that the bicycle is picking up speed. You’re already 
going so fast that the wind is making your eyes water. If you hit anything, you’ll 
be a goner for sure! 

Should you jump off now? Or would you rather stay on and see where the 
bike takes you? 


If you want to get off, jump off the bike on PAGE 69 . 

If you’d rather not jump, stay on until you reach PAGE 45 .

“Jason’s right. We should look for the Queen’s mirror in this hall before we 
go on,” you say. 

You examine the mirrors near you. Some are round. Some are square. Some 
are shaped like hearts. You peer into each of them. They all seem ordinary to 
you. 

But then, you don’t know what a queen’s mirror looks like. 

“Maybe the Queen’s mirror has her name on it,” Stacey suggests. 

It’s an idea. You begin checking the mirrors for names. But the only writing 
you find says made in Taiwan. 

Then you spot something green glittering in a corner. You step over the 
mirrors for a closer look. But all you find is a green mirrored door, set back into 
a nook in the wall. 

Hmm. Should you investigate what’s behind the green door? Or should you 
forget it and rejoin your friends? 


If you try the door, turn to PAGE 7 . 

If you rejoin your friends, turn to PAGE 128 .

Sitting up, you pull the two halves of the box out of your pocket and 
examine them. One has a single red button on it. The other half has eleven 
buttons. Nine are black, with mysterious symbols printed on them. The last two 
are white. They’re labeled rewind and fast forward. 

You twist the pieces in your hands. How do they fit together? 

SNAP! The two halves click into place. Wow! There isn’t even a crack 
where the break was. The box looks as good as new. It’s clearly some fancy kind 
of remote control. 

Should you return it to Professor Shock? you wonder. 

Before you can decide, a green laser beam shoots out from the end of the 
remote. The end that’s pointing toward you. 


What’s going on? Turn to PAGE 57 to find out. 




51 


Quickly, the twins rip the gag off Uncle Jack’s mouth. 

“Stacey! Jason!” he cries. “How did you get here?” 

“It’s a long story,” Stacey replies. As she and Jason untie him, she tells 
Uncle Jack about finding Red in his store. 

“He told us he bought the store,” Jason adds. 

“He’s lying,” Uncle Jack declares. “He came into the store last night, asking 
questions about my friend, Professor Shock. But I knew better than to trust him. 
When I tried to call the police, he tied me up and locked me in here. I’ve got to 
get out! I have to stop him before he gets his hands on Shock’s new invention, 
the Universal Remote!” 

You wish he hadn’t said that. “He — well, he might already have it,” you 
admit. You explain about the remote you took from the professor’s workshop 
and how Red grabbed it from you. “I didn’t know it was an important 
invention,” you finish lamely. 

“Oh, no!” Uncle Jack cries. “This is a disaster!” 

“What’s the big deal?” Jason asks. “It does neat tricks. But it’s still only a 
remote control.” 

“It’s much more than that!” Uncle Jack declares. “In the wrong hands, it’s a 
deadly weapon. And Red’s hands are the wrong hands, believe me. You see, Red 
is a cyborg!” 


Turn to PAGE 68. 




52 


Better think up a lie! “We came here by accident,” you say. “We were just 
about to leave —” 

“LIAR!” the Queen thunders. “I know why you’re here! My mirror tells me 
everything!” 

“Then you know we’re trying to get back home!” you exclaim. “Please, 
won’t you turn my friends back —” 

“Your friends will remain carvings,” the Queen says coldly. “But you won’t 
join them. Not yet, anyway. Not as long as you do what I want.” She smiles. 

It’s not a nice smile. “Wh-what do you want?” you ask. 

“I told you, my mirror tells me everything,” the Queen answers. “Except 
how beautiful I am. For that, I need you.” 

“You want me to lie to you?” you blurt out. 

The Queen scowls. “Are you saying I’m not beautiful?” 

“Of-of course not, Your Highness,” you stammer. You gaze at her hideous, 
blotchy face. “You’re actually, uh, very pretty.” 

“That’s better,” the Queen murmurs. She smiles. “Tell me, what do you think 
of my nose?” 

Uh-oh. The Queen wants lies. If you don’t keep telling them to her, you’ll be 
turned to stone. This could go on for a long time. Avery long time. 

To tell the truth, this looks suspiciously like 


THE END.

The water of the lake only comes to your knees. You start for the boat. 

“This is easy!” Jason marvels. 

Too easy? you wonder. You glance nervously around, scanning the water for 
dark fins. But it’s all clear. No sharks. 

You’ve almost reached the boat when Stacey screams. 

You whirl around. Something big and black has swooped down from the sky 
and grabbed her. 

Something with fins! And lots of sharp teeth! 

“What was that?” Jason shrieks. 

You can’t believe it! It’s a shark. A flying shark! 

When you glance at the sky, your eyes widen in horror. Heading for you are 
more flying sharks. Hundreds of them! 

Then one of the things zooms at you. You duck. But it’s no good. Daggerlike 
teeth close on your body. You’re whisked up, up and away. Jason is next to you, 
screaming horribly. 

Too bad! It looks as if this adventure has come to a very fishy 


THE END. 


54 

“Wait for me!” you call, dashing after Stacey and Jason. You race past the 
piles of boxes and old furniture in the garage. You don’t even glance at the 
rusted car and machinery. 

Speeding outside, you jump on your bike. The twins are already way down 
the street. You pedal as fast as you can for your own neighborhood. 

After a few blocks, you glance back. Whew! No sign of Professor Shock. 
You’re home free. 

When you reach your house, you grab some cookies from the kitchen and 
head upstairs. You feel like relaxing for a while. You slip on your headphones 
and lie down on your bed to listen to some music. 

That’s when you remember the broken black box in your pocket. 


Turn to PAGE 50.

You did it! You escaped! 

You and the twins bob in the middle of the lake. On the far side, the Palace 
gleams in the sun. Colored light reflects off its shiny sides. It seems to be made 
entirely of mirrors. 

“It’s beautiful!” Stacey exclaims. 

“So what?” Jason grumbles. “It’s probably as crazy as everything else in this 
backward place.” 

You’ve learned your lesson, so you row as hard as you can in the wrong 
direction. The boat moves swiftly toward the Palace. Soon, with a gentle bump, 
you land on the shore. 

You and the twins climb out of the boat and gaze upward. The Palace of 
Mirrors is enormous! The gleaming walls reflect the lake, the trees, and the sky. 

You made it! Now all you have to do is find the Queen’s mirror. 


Begin your search on PAGE 12 . 



56 

A quiz? You and the twins exchange glances. Then, shrugging, you head for 
the back row. You’ll wait and see what happens. 

“Arnie!” Ms. Silver shouts. A blond, freckled boy stands up. “What is seven 
times seven?” she asks him. 

“Forty-nine,” the boy replies. 

Ms. Silver frowns. “I can’t accept that answer! Go stand in the closet.” 

Arnie turns pale. “No!” he cries. “Not that!” 

“You know the rules!” Ms. Silver insists. Grabbing Arnie by the ear, she 
marches him to a door at the back of the room. 

“Please —” he begs. His voice is shaking. 

Ms. Silver throws open the door. “Enter!” she snaps. She shoves him inside 
and slams the door behind him. 

A moment later there’s a long, horrible scream. 

Your heart races. What’s in that closet? But before you can figure it out, Ms. 
Silver points at you. 

“Let’s see what our new pupils know,” she exclaims. “For your sake, I hope 
you can do better than Arnie!”

ZZZT7 The laser beam bounces off your mp3 player. 

The music suddenly grows louder. 

Quickly, you turn the volume down. But the sound keeps swelling. It’s 
hurting your ears! 

You switch the device off. 

The music plays on! It blares in your ears, so loud you think your brain will 
fry! 

Dropping the remote, you try to yank the headphones off your head. But 
they won’t budge. It’s as if they’re glued in place. 

“Help!” you cry. But you can’t even hear your own voice. 

The music is so loud your whole head is vibrating. Your eyes feel as if 
they’re about to pop out. You’ve got to do something. This is dangerous! 

Think! you urge yourself. Your device went crazy right after you put the 
remote together. Maybe if you break it apart again, the player will leave you 
alone. 

Or maybe you should try pressing one of the remote buttons. 

Better decide quickly — before your brain explodes! 


Try to break the remote apart on PAGE 80 . 
Press one of the buttons on PAGE 31 .

A giant, bloodred eye is staring back at you. 

It’s so big it fills the entire mirror. Its pupil is just a slit, like a cat’s eye. And 
its expression is pure evil. 

Jason screams. And screams! 

“Don’t worry,” you manage, though your throat is dry with fear. “It can’t get 
us. It’s on the wrong side of the mirror, remember? It’s just a reflection. A trick 
of some kind.” 

You really hope you’re right about that! 

“It’s getting smaller,” Stacey whispers. “I think maybe it’s backing away.” 

You force yourself to study the eye. Stacey’s right — it is getting smaller. 
What a relief! Everything’s going to be all right, you think. 

Until you notice the giant hand. With clutching, groping fingers and long, 
talonlike nails. 

The hand that’s reaching right through the mirror. 

Reaching for you! 

“I thought you said it couldn’t get us!” Jason yells. 

The giant hand closes around you. Then it starts to squeeze. 

Okay. You were wrong. But don’t feel too crushed about it! 


THE END 



59 


Jason jumps up. “Help! I want out!” 

“Hold on!” you call. “Don’t panic!” 

“There’s got to be a way out,” Stacey declares. 

You stare at the mirrors. An idea is forming in your mind. “If we came in 
through the mirror, maybe that’s the way out, too. Maybe we can escape through 
one of these mirrors.” 

“But which one?” Jason demands. 

You study the two mirrors. The one on your right seems ordinary. It reflects 
you and the twins. 

The one on your left is a different story. In fact, you wonder if there’s a 
hidden movie projector in the room. Because the mirror shows a peaceful 
country meadow full of grazing cows. 

Which mirror will you try? 


If you choose the one with the country scene, turn to PAGE 47 . 

If you pick the one that reflects you and the twins, go to PAGE 123 . 





60 


Jason’s right. The mirror has vanished! 

You can \ go back to the little room! 

“We’ll be fine,” Stacey declares. “Professor Shock said all we have to do to 
get out of here is find something.” 

“But he didn’t say what we need to find,” Jason retorts. “We’re trapped. 
Maybe forever.” 

You sure hope Jason’s wrong. You stare around. There must be some clue, 
something that will tell you what to do next. 

Then, across the field, you spot a green sign. It looks like a regular road sign 
— except that there’s no road nearby. 

“Maybe that sign will tell us something,” you suggest. 

Stacey immediately races toward the sign. You and Jason take off after her. 
Tall, blue grass tickles your ankles. It feels good to run. Until you realize that 
something is wrong. 

You’ve been running for several minutes. But — “The sign looks farther 
away than when we started!” you blurt out. 

You and your friends stop running and turn to gaze back the way you came. 
You’ve definitely covered some ground. 

“Weird,” Stacey pants. 

“Maybe it’s an optical illusion,” Jason suggests. 

Before you can reply, something grunts. Right behind you. 


Jump to PAGE 97 . 




61 


You think you’d better not take any chances. 

“Run! Again!” you scream at Stacey and Jason. 

The three of you tear out of the back room. Red pounds after you. “Not so 
fast,” he yells. “I want that remote!” 

He is after the remote! Is he working with Deep Voice? you wonder. But 
there’s no time to think about it now. 

You race to the front of the shop and grab the doorknob. 

ZAP! A fat blue spark leaps out from the metal. 

“Ow!” you yell. The doorknob is electrified! 

You face Red. “Let us out!” you demand. 

“First give me the remote,” he replies. 

“Why?” you cry. “What will you do with it?” 

“And what did you do with Uncle Jack?” Jason adds. 

“Enough questions,” Red snarls. He paces slowly toward you. 

You gulp. He’s huge. He’s mean. He looks strong. 

“There’s a back way out,” Jason whispers in your ear. 

“Use the remote,” Stacey suggests softly in your other ear. 

It’s up to you! But choose quickly. 


If you try to escape out the back, turn to PAGE 71 . 

If you try to use the remote somehow, go to PAGE 134 .

“Welcome to the Hall of Ten Thousand Mirrors!” a hollow voice echoes. 

“Who are you?” you cry. You spin around to see who is speaking. But all 
you see is hundreds of your reflections, gazing at you from the small, square 
mirrors. 

“It doesn’t matter who I am,” the voice responds. 

“Could you tell me how to get out of here?” you ask. 

“I could,” the voice says. “But that would spoil all the fun. Find the way out 
for yourself.” 

“Let me go!” you demand. “I never did anything to you. I’m getting tired of 
being shoved around!” 

“Calm down,” the voice tells you. “I’ll give you a hint. To escape from this 
room, all you have to do is find the mirror with a tiny red dot in the corner. That 
mirror will lead you out.” 

Search out one tiny red dot in all those mirrors? It’s impossible! “What if I 
can’t find it?” you ask. 

“Then you’ll remain here forever,” the voice replies. 

“But —” you start to protest. 

“Better get started,” the voice interrupts. “There are ten thousand mirrors in 
here.” 


Quick! Go to PAGE 110 . 




63 


Wind roars past your ears. It’s as if you’re caught in a tornado! You can’t see 
your legs anymore. They’re inside the mirror! You grab the frame and hang on. 
Invisible forces rip at your fingers, trying to pry them loose. 

“Stacey! Jason!” you scream. “Help me!” 

But your friends are screaming, too. They’re being pulled into the mirror 
with you! 

You’re inside as far as your neck now. Then a wrinkled face appears, framed 
by the back legs of the pinball machine. It’s Professor Shock! He peers at you. 

“Help us!” you shout. 

“I can’t!” he screams. “I told you to stay away! There’s no way out of there 
unless you find the —” 

POP! 

Your hands lose their grip. And the professor vanishes. 


Let the wind blow you to PAGE 32 . 




64 


“Turn around!” you shout. 

“Huh?” Jason gasps. “Did you happen to notice we’re being chased by a 
raging bull?” 

“I think I know how to beat him!” you pant. 

“How?” Stacey demands. 

“Run toward him!” you exclaim. “We’re in a mirror world. Things are 
backward here — like the colors. So maybe this chase is backward, too. Maybe 
if we run toward the bull, we’ll get away from him!” 

Stacey disagrees. “That’s crazy. Let’s split up and keep running away. The 
bull can’t chase all three of us!” 

Maybe Stacey’s plan is better than yours. If only you had a little time to 
think it over. 

But you don’t. Quick! Make a decision now! 


Run toward the bull on PAGE 105 . 

Split up and keep running away to PAGE 46 . 





65 


You remember the warning Professor Shock gave you from the mirror. 
“Wait!” you cry. “Don’t touch it!” 

“Stacey!” Jason shouts. He grabs her and tries to pull her back. 

But it’s too late. Stacey touches the rose. 

POP! Both your friends vanish. Just like that. 

You gaze around in panic. But there’s no sign of them. 

They’re gone. 


Go on to PAGE 82. 




66 


You gaze into the mirror, hoping to see the world you came from. The real 
world. 

Instead, you see — nothing. 

There is no reflection inside this mirror! Behind the glass, there’s just — 
nothing. 

“Creepy!” Stacey mutters. “What kind of mirror is this?” 

“A backward mirror,” you answer with a sigh. “But maybe we can step 
through it. Maybe it will take us back home.” 

“I doubt it,” Jason says glumly. “We still haven’t found whatever Professor 
Shock told us to find. But let’s try it.” 

“I don’t want to go yet! I want to see the Loreo,” Stacey objects. “Come on, 
let’s sit down.” 

“No! Let’s go!” Jason whines. 

You’re feeling cranky yourself. Should you just give up on the Loreo and try 
the mirror? Or would you rather wait for the Loreo after all? 


Which will it be? Step through the mirror on PAGE 28 . or wait for the 
Loreo on PAGE 125. 





67 


“Oh, no! It’s happening again!” Stacey cries. 

She’s right. Once again, your reflections are shrieking in soundless terror. 
Yours throws up its hands. Stacey’s starts to tremble. Jason’s puts its hands over 
its eyes. 

Then, just as before, they turn and run away! 

“Wait!” you scream. Lunging forward, you dive headfirst into the big mirror. 
Jason and Stacey are right behind you. 

Your body tingles. Then you tumble out onto the wooden floor of an empty 
ice-cream parlor. A moving shadow makes you look up. 

A white ceiling fan circles lazily overhead. 

You’re in Miller’s! 

“Not again!” Stacey exclaims. 

“It’s deja vu,” Jason moans. 

This time, the mirror is on the left-hand wall. You peek at your reflection. 
And as soon as you lock eyes, it happens again. The screaming. The running 
away. 

Finally, you get it. 

Your reflection is mnning away from ... you! 

You don’t know why. All you know is, you’ve got to keep after your 
reflection until you catch it. 

Even if it takes the rest of your life.... 


THE END 



68 


You stare at Uncle Jack. Maybe being tied up has made him a little funny in 
the head! “Red is a cyborg ?” you repeat. 

Yeah, right! 

But Uncle Jack nods solemnly. “He’s half human, half machine. Professor 
Shock invented the technology to make cyborgs years ago. I helped. I built Red’s 
circuits. And now he’s the leader of a band of rebel cyborgs!” 

Uncle Jack is starting to scare you. He sounds completely serious. Could he 
be telling the truth? 

Stacey and Jason appear to be convinced. And they know Uncle Jack better 
than you do. 

“Wh-what do the cyborgs want?” Stacey stammers. 

“Power,” Uncle Jack replies. “Cyborgs are bigger, stronger, and faster than 
natural humans. They think that makes them better. Red told me about their 
plan.” 

He stares at each of you in turn. Leaning forward, he whispers, “They want 
to make us their slaves!” 


Turn to PAGE 81 . 




69 


You realize you’d better jump off the bike now, while you still can. 

“Aaahh!” you scream as you throw yourself off the speeding machine. 

THUD! You hit the ground rolling. You’ll probably have a few bruises, but 
you decide bruises aren’t so terrible. 

Standing up, you gaze around. Excellent! By sheer chance, you ended up 
only a block from Professor Shock’s house. Soon he’ll put an end to this 
mechanical nightmare! 

You run past spouting garden hoses and whining weed-whackers, straight to 
Professor Shock’s garage. The professor is probably in his workshop. Cleaning 
up the mess you made! 

“Professor Shock?” you call. “Are you here?” 

No answer. You walk slowly through the cluttered garage toward the green 
workshop door. It’s closed. 

From behind the door comes a whirring sound. 

Slowly, carefully, you push the door open. It’s hard to see inside, because the 
lights keep blinking on and off. 

“Come in,” a voice calls. “I’ve been expecting you.” 


Who ’s been expecting you ? Turn to PAGE 98 to find out. 




70 


You press your left thumb down on one of the remote buttons. 

The lights in the elevator blink on. You hear a faint whirring sound. 

Slowly, slowly, the elevator begins to drop. 

“But we want to go up,” Stacey complains. 

“Who cares!” Jason cries. “I just want out of here!” 

The elevator bumps to a stop. Something makes you tuck the remote into 
your pocket just before the doors slide open. 

You’re back in the garage. 

Someone dressed all in black is standing in front of the elevator. Someone 
huge. This guy makes Shaquille O’Neal look like a midget! 

A hat pulled down low hides his face. But you know it must be the person 
who chased you before. Deep Voice. 

He reaches toward you. His black-gloved hand looks big enough to palm a 
beach ball. 

“Give it to me!” he growls. 


Go to PAGE 112. 




71 


You decide to go for the shop’s back door. Maybe you can outfox Red. “Split 
up,” you whisper to the twins. 

You duck to the left. Jason lunges to the right. And Stacey dives straight at 
Red’s knees! 

“Hey!” the huge man yells. He looks surprised. And furious ! “Who-o-oa!” 
he cries and topples over backward. 

CRASH! The floor shakes when his body hits it. 

“Nice move, Stacey!” you cheer. 

The three of you race through the back door, tear down the hall, and clatter 
downstairs to the mall’s first level. 

You hurry past the old Kiddie Karnival. Your mom used to leave you there to 
ride the bumper cars while she went shopping. Now the little cars are covered 
with dust. The poles that connect each car to the power grid have been removed. 

Too bad! you think. You used to love those bumper cars. 

Stacey suddenly cries out. You stop and turn around. 

She’s limping and clutching her ankle. “I twisted it,” she explains. “I can’t 
walk!” 

“I want that remote!” Red’s voice roars from the stairwell. 

Uh-oh. He’s coming! 

Then you have a great idea. 


Help Stacey hobble to PAGE 122 . 



72 

The only furniture in the professor’s living room is a big armchair. It’s 
surrounded by dozens of televisions. All are on, their volume cranked up. It’s so 
noisy you can’t think! 

The professor seats himself in the chair and then turns to you with a smile. “I 
like to watch all the TV sets at once!” he shouts. “But I hate to get up and change 
the channels. Since you broke my remote, you can change them for me!” 

“But —” you start to object. 

“Get to it!” he orders. “Or do you want me to call your parents and tell them 
what you did?” 

Quickly, you shake your head. 

“Good.” The professor leans back in his chair. “Change that one to channel 
33,” he tells you, pointing at one of the TVs. “Then turn the volume up on that 
one. Then change that one over there to channel 72. Then fix the picture on that 
one....” 

You dash around the room, trying to follow his orders. 

“Faster!” Professor Shock commands. 

There isn’t even time to catch your breath! It’s awful. You love to channel 
surf. But not like this! 

Professor Shock might keep watching forever. But for you, the show’s over. 
It’s 


THE END. 



73 


You gulp. Ms. Silver is pointing straight at you. You’re on the spot now! 

“I don’t get it,” Jason whispers. “Arnie was right. Seven times seven is forty- 
nine ! Why did she punish him?” 

“Don’t forget, we’re in a backward world. Maybe she wanted a backward 
answer,” Stacey replies. 

“Silence!” Ms. Silver shrieks. “Now tell me: What is seven plus eight?” 

You’re starting to sweat. If you don’t give Ms. Silver the answer she wants, 
you’ll end up in the closet, just like Arnie. 

And you know that would be really bad news! 

“I’m waiting,” Ms. Silver snarls. 


If you think the best answer is the real answer, fifteen, turn to PAGE 88 . 
If you think the answer the teacher wants is fifty-one, try PAGE 14 . 




74 

GUGUGUGUGUGUG! The floor suddenly starts to shake. A giant, silver 
ball shoots from a tube on your right. It slams into the back wall, bounces off, 
and hurtles down the sloping floor. Right toward you! 

“Look out!” Stacey yells. 

“Yipe!” you squeak, and dive to the side. 

Just in time. The enormous silver ball rumbles past you and smashes into 
one of the targets. 

DING-DING-DING! Bells ring. The target flashes. 

That’s when it all falls into place. You know where you are. And you realize 
it’s not Professor Shock who changed size. 

It’s you! 

Maybe it was the remote. Maybe it was the blue light in the elevator. But 
something has made you shrink to the size of a marble. And something has 
dumped you where you are now — 

Inside Professor Shock’s pinball machine! 

You gaze around frantically for the silver ball. To your relief, it appears to be 
losing speed. 

Then the entire floor heaves up to the left. You lose your balance and tumble 
to the floor. The silver ball zooms at you. 

No fair! Professor Shock is tilting! 

And you’re 


THE END. 



75 


“We’ve got to find a way to go through the window,” you say. 

“We could pile some of the furniture up and use it like a ladder,” Jason 
points out. 

He’s really pretty smart. 

Uncle Jack helps you and the twins shove a table underneath the window. 
You stack an armchair on top of it. Then you balance a stool on top of that. The 
pile looks very shaky. But it reaches almost to the bottom of the window. 

“I’m too big to fit through the window,” Uncle Jack tells you. “You kids will 
have to go through and then come back and unlock the door for me.” 

You climb up onto the table. Then the chair. Then the stool. The whole pile 
wobbles. You feel like a circus acrobat. 

Very carefully, you slide the small window up. Luckily for you, it isn’t 
painted shut. Grasping the windowsill, you pull yourself through. Into a row of 
garbage cans at the back of the employee parking lot. 

It stinks. Yuck. 

But you made it! 

Then a cold hand grips your shoulder. “Where do you think you’re going?” a 
voice demands. 


See who’s got you on PAGE 104 . 



76 

You stare, frozen in terror, at Red. You’re going to run him over with your 
bumper car! This is terrible! 

Red may be evil, but you don’t want to flatten him! 

At the last second, Red jumps aside. Reaching down, he snatches the remote 
control off your dashboard. 

“Got it!” he grunts. 

Oh, no. If only you’d flattened him! 

Red’s huge fingers dance over the remote control, punching button after 
button. Your heart sinks right down to your toes. Obviously, he knows exactly 
how to use the gadget. 

A moment later, your bumper car swerves around and zooms out of the ring. 
You spin the steering wheel. No use. You can’t control the car. 

Jason and Stacey’s cars race along on either side of yours. The three of you 
are heading straight for a bank of elevators. 

You start to panic. Really panic. 

Is Red going to make you crash? 


Turn to PAGE 96 for the answer. 




77 


You stand on your porch steps, staring. You’ve walked into a mechanical 
madhouse! 

Alawnmower roars around your lawn, cutting fancy patterns in the grass. No 
one is pushing it. 

Cars weave up and down the street. You peer through the windows. There 
doesn’t appear to be anyone driving them! 

WHZZ! WHZZ! An electric can opener wriggles through the open front door 
and down the porch steps. Its cord trails behind it. It isn’t even plugged in, but 
somehow it’s running! 

There are no people in sight. They must all be inside. Hiding from the 
machines. 

You close your eyes and give yourself a pinch on the arm. Can this really be 
happening? Or are you having a nightmare? 

When you open your eyes again, the first thing you see is your bike. 

Zooming right toward you. The pedals churn — around and around. But there’s 
no one riding it. 

Yikes! 

No time to move out of the way. Your reflexes take over. Without thinking, 
you grab the handlebars and jump on. 


Ride your bike to PAGE 48 . 



78 

As the last bits of mirror seal themselves around you, three kids appear in 
the tent. Right where you were a moment ago. The three new kids gaze into the 
mirror. 

One looks just like Stacey. Another is identical to Jason. 

And the third looks exactly like you! 

The one that looks like you raises its arm. Your own arm rises at the same 
moment. You can’t seem to stop it. 

The kid that looks like Stacey jumps up and down. Beside you, the real 
Stacey jumps too. The kid that looks like Jason claps his hands. You hear Jason 
clapping at the same time. 

Oh, no ... 

“Thanks!” the kid that looks like you shouts. You feel your own mouth form 
the word Thanks. 

“We hated being in the mirror,” the one that looks like Stacey says. “Now 
it’s your turn for a while!” 

“Like ... for the rest of your lives!” the Jason-clone adds with a nasty laugh. 

You’ve traded places with your own reflections! Jason was right, you think. 
It is bad luck to break a mirror. 

Oh, well. That’s the breaks. 


THE END 



79 


“Stacey!” you cry. “Jason! Is it really you?” 

“Of course it’s us!” Jason replies. 

“But you’re so — so clean!” you exclaim. “You both have new haircuts. And 
new clothes!” Jason and Stacey stare at each other. Then they glance down at 
their new clothes. “Cool!” Stacey cries. “How did this happen?” Jason asks. 

“You got polished,” the Queen mutters. “What did you expect?” 

You’re ready to leave this place. “You promised to let us use your mirror,” 
you remind the Queen. She glares at you, then opens a secret panel in the wall. A 
round, gold-framed mirror appears. You and the twins rush up to it and gaze in. 

“Look!” Stacey cries. “There are words in it!” 

You peer at the swirling letters in the glass. You’re sure the words are 
instructions for returning to your own world. There’s only one problem. They’re 
in a strange writing. 



If you can read this secret writing, you know what to do. Turn to PAGE 
107 . 

If you can’t read it, go to PAGE 93 for a hint. 





80 

You grab the remote from your bed where you dropped it. You don’t have 
time to fiddle with the thing. This is an emergency! 

As hard as you can, you hurl the remote against your bedroom door. 
CRASH! The black case shatters. Springs pop. Sparks fly. 

And the deafening music stops. 

Whew! You rip off the headphones and throw the mp3 player across the 
room. It hits the floor next to the remote. 

ZAP! A giant yellow spark leaps out of the broken remote control. And into 
your player. 

Uh-oh. Why is the device quivering? you wonder. And why does it look ... 
bigger? 

In seconds, the awful truth is clear. 

Somehow, when that spark hit the mp3 player, it made it start growing. You 
don’t know how. Or why. But the thing is expanding in front of your eyes. And 
expanding! Soon the player is bigger than you are! And it’s still growing. 

It’s also blocking the bedroom door. You’re trapped. 

You cower on your bed, watching in horror as the player looms over you. It 
bulges against the walls and ceiling. 

You always wanted to fill your room with music. Unfortunately, this isn’t 
what you had in mind. 

In fact, this is 


THE END! 



81 


Your heart is beating double time. You’re convinced. If Uncle Jack says a 
bunch of cyborgs want to make you their slave, you believe him! 

Jason is pale. But his scientific mind is at work. “Where does the Universal 
Remote fit in?” he asks. 

“Professor Shock was afraid the cyborgs might turn against us. So he built 
the Universal Remote to control them,” Uncle Jack explains. “Now that they 
have it, we have no control. But it’s worse than that.” 

Worse? You shudder. What could be worse than a bunch of eight-foot, super- 
strongman-machines running wild? 

“You see, the remote can control all machines,” Uncle Jack goes on. “The 
cyborgs can use it to turn appliances against us. Imagine being attacked by your 
own TV!” 

“Oh, no!” you exclaim. You remember Jason’s model plane dive-bombing 
you. “We have to get the remote back!” 

“Right,” Uncle Jack agrees. “But first we must break out of this basement.” 

You gaze around. You could try to reach the window. Which looks awfully 
small and high up. Or you could try to break down the door. Which looks 
awfully thick. 


Try to wriggle through the window on PAGE 75 . 
Try to break down the door on PAGE 6 .

“Stacey!” you cry. “Jason!” 

No answer. A moment later you hear footsteps. You whirl. 

A nightmare creature stands right behind you. Blue blotches cover its 
leathery features. Its hair looks more like filthy gray feathers than hair. It wears a 
long, shapeless black dress draped with strings of carved stone beads. 

The creature opens its mouth, revealing long, pointed yellow teeth. “Who 
dares trespass in my room?” it demands. 

You’re shaking in terror. But you must help the twins. “We — we thought 
this was the Queen’s room,” you reply. 

“I AM THE QUEEN!” the creature thunders. 

“You’re the Queen?” you repeat, shocked. 

“This is my chamber,” she tells you. “Your friends tried to steal one of my 
carvings. I punished them!” 

“Where — where are they?” you stammer. 

The Queen smiles. It’s an ugly, ugly smile. She points to the ceiling. You 
stare up at the hundreds of hanging stone figures. And then you gasp, as you 
understand what she means. 

She’s turned the twins into carvings! 

“What do you want?” the Queen demands. 


Think over your answer. If you decide to tell the truth, turn to PAGE 101 . 
If you think a lie would be safer, turn to PAGE 52 . 



83 

You decide to take the remote back to the professor. He must have missed it 
by now. You don’t want him to think you stole it! 

As you’re leaving your room, you hear a sound behind you. You glance 
back. Your model train is chugging toward you. 

And it’s off the tracks! 

You feel a sudden chill. How did that happen? You were sure you turned the 
train off before. Quickly, you aim the remote at the train and click. The cars stop 
moving. 

Maybe there’s something wrong with the remote. Maybe its insides got 
scrambled when it fell on the floor of Professor Shock’s garage. Maybe there’s a 
short circuit somewhere. 

Whatever it is, Professor Shock can probably fix it. You’re suddenly in a 
hurry to get the remote back to him. There’s something about it that gives you 
the creeps. 

You rush downstairs. There’s a lot of noise coming from the kitchen. It 
sounds as if your mom is running all her appliances at once. But you don’t have 
time to pop in and find out what’s for dinner. 

You race out the front door. And then you screech to a halt. 

What in the world is going on? 


Turn to PAGE 77. 



84 

You decide to give Professor Shock five minutes to nap. 

But then the monster robot stirs into life. VROOM! VROOM! Its engines 
roar. It starts rolling toward you on its huge, steamroller feet. 

“Yikes!” Jason shrieks. “We’re doomed!” 

You shake Professor Shock’s arm. “Wake up!” you yell. “Tell us what to do! 
Time is running out!” 

The old man’s eyes pop open. “Eh? What’s that?” 

You point a trembling finger at the monster robot. 

“Oh, that.” Professor Shock frowns. “All right, here’s the plan: You kids run 
to the fire substation in the mall. Turn on the water and bring the fire hose back 
here.” 

Water? A fire hose? Does he really think that’s going to help against this 
giant metal menace? 

But it’s the only plan you have. So you, Stacey, and Jason take off. 


Hurry! Look for a hose on PAGE 21 . 




85 


You gaze down, terrified. Water rushes by below you. It’s the lake! 

There was a giant sling inside the closet, and it shot you right out of the 
building! Screaming, you and the twins plunge toward the water. The shark- 
infested water. 

SPLOOSH! SPLOOSH! SPLOOSH! You land in a white froth. 

You close your eyes, waiting to feel shark teeth ripping into your body. 

Nothing happens. 

You open your eyes. You’re bobbing next to a small blue rowboat. The 
policeman’s boat! It’s empty. It must have come loose and drifted away. What a 
break! 

“Get in!” you order Stacey and Jason. You hold the boat steady while they 
scramble in. Then they grab your arms and haul you up to join them. 

Not a second too soon! As you’re crawling over the side of the rowboat, 
Stacey yells, “Shark!” 

“Make that ‘sharks’!” Jason adds. 

You turn around and peer over the side. Sharp black fins circle the boat. 
These sharks look big. And hungry. 

“Too bad, sharks,” you call. “We’re out of here!” 


Go to PAGE 55. 


86 


Your eyes widen in horror. The robot is trying to strangle Jason! “Duck!” 
you shout. 

But when Jason ducks out of the way, the robot doesn’t seem to notice. 
Instead it lurches wildly across the room. Bangs into the wall. Spins around. 
Walks into a chair. Next, it starts knocking things off the tables. Its arms whirl 
like windmills, smashing into everything that’s near them. 

The robot is out of control! You wonder if Jason knocked its circuits loose 
when he whacked it on the back. 

“Turn it off!” Stacey screeches. 

Snapping out of your horrified daze, you start for the back of the shop. 
You’ve got to reach the red switch! 

Oh, no! The robot is moving toward Professor Shock’s desk. It’s stacked 
with books and complicated charts. A flat, black box with rows of buttons 
balances atop a pile of papers. 

“No!” you shout. Professor Shock will boil you in oil if you let the robot 
mess up his work. You leap toward the desk. If you can only move the papers out 
of the way ... 

But the robot is faster. SMASH! CRASH! Its metal arm sweeps across the 
desktop, knocking everything to the floor. 

At that moment Professor Shock rushes through the door. 


Go to PAGE 40. 




87 


You spin around, following Professor Shock’s gaze. 

The employee parking lot is full of wrecking equipment. Bulldozers. 
Steamrollers. Cranes. Wrecking balls. 

Standing in the middle of all these machines is a familiar, eight-foot-tall 
figure. Red. His fingers fly over the remote. 

CLANK! CLAEStK! The wrecking machines roar into sudden life. Two huge 
steamrollers position themselves side by side. 

“Feet,” Professor Shock mutters. 

You, Stacey, and Jason exchange worried glances. Feet? 

A big crane lifts up two bulldozers and sets them on top of the steamrollers. 
The bulldozers’ shovels wave in the air. 

“Hands,” Professor Shock says, nodding. 

TINKLE-LINKLE-LINK! Glass shatters overhead. Glancing up, you spot two 
big-screen TVs sailing through the air. 

“Eyes,” Professor Shock says grimly. 

“Eyes?” you echo. You’re almost afraid to ask. “Feet? Hands? Wh-what are 
you talking about, Professor?” 

Professor Shock points at the pile of machinery. “Can’t you see?” he asks. 
“Red is using my remote to build a monster robot!” 


Oh, no! Do you really want to turn to PAGE 120 ? 


88 

You decide to give the teacher the real answer. But just in case, you whisper 
a backup plan to the twins. 

“What is seven and eight?” Ms. Silver demands. 

“Fifteen,” you reply. 

“Wrong!” she shouts. “To the closet!” 

“No thanks!” you declare. You give the twins a thumbs-up signal. Then the 
three of you split up and zoom toward the door. 

“Come back!” Ms. Silver shouts. “You’ll never escape! There are sharks!” 

You ignore her and run outside. The Palace gleams on the other side of the 
lake. A blue rowboat bobs at anchor just a few feet from the shore. 

“Come on,” you tell your friends. “We’ll wade to the boat and then row to 
the Palace.” 

“Wh-what about the sharks?” Jason stammers. 

“I don’t see any,” Stacey says. The three of you gaze into the clear water. 
There’s no sign of sharks. 

“Sharks don’t live in lakes. Ms. Silver was trying to scare us,” you declare 
and wade into the lake. 


Go on to PAGE 53.

“We’re stuck!” Stacey cries. “The elevator was a trap!” 

“Help!” Jason yells. 

“Stay calm,” you say, even though you’re starting to panic. You grope in the 
darkness and press the elevator buttons. 

Nothing happens. 

“Can we climb out?” Stacey suggests. 

“Too dangerous. Try the remote!” Jason tells you. 

Hey! It might work. After all, the elevator is a machine. You pull the remote 
out of your pocket. 

You hold it in both hands. So many buttons. You can’t tell which ones are 
which in the dark. Should you press the button under your right thumb? Or the 
one under your left? 

CRRREAKKK! 

The elevator sways. Then drops three feet! 

You all scream. 

“Come on!” Stacey urges. “Choose a button now!” 


You’ve got a fifty-fifty chance of getting it right. The odds are even. What 
about you? Are you even or odd? Count up the letters in your first name. 

If you have an odd number of letters, go to PAGE 135 . 

If you have an even number, turn to PAGE 70 . 




90 

You turn to Professor Shock in — well, in shock. 

“What happened?” you demand. 

“Was it the water?” Jason adds. “Did we short out the robot after all? 

“No, I don’t think so.” Professor Shock strokes his beard thoughtfully. “It 
was the remote. It stopped working.” 

“But why? How?” Stacey asks. 

“The batteries must have run down,” Professor Shock answers. 

“The batteries ?” you sputter. You just escaped being crushed by a bulldozer, 
and the human race just escaped becoming slaves to a cyborg, because the 
batteries ran down? 

Professor Shock shrugs. “That’s right.” 

Then he smiles. 

“What’s so funny?” you want to know. 

Professor Shock’s smile grows wider. “I was just thinking.... Good thing I 
didn’t use Supergizers!” 


THE END 



91 


Taking a deep breath, you punch your finger down on the red button. 

The remote lets out a short, high-pitched buzzing sound. But your Walkman 
doesn’t turn on. In fact, as far as you can tell, nothing happens. 

“What a rip-off,” you grumble and press another of the black buttons. 

All the lights in the room blink on! 

You hit the button again. The lights go off. 

A third button controls your TV. A fourth turns your model train on and off. 
Even though it’s made of wood! 

Cool, you think. Professor Shock’s box is some kind of Super-remote! 

That reminds you. The remote does belong to Professor Shock. You know 
you should return it. 

But maybe you don’t have to return it right this minute. You’d really like to 
show it to Jason and Stacey.... 


What do you think? If you choose to return the remote to the professor 
right away, go to PAGE 83 . 

If you’d rather show it to the twins first, turn to PAGE 11 . 




92 

You’ll never make it through the gap fast enough to escape the Loreo. “All 
together!” you shout. “We’ll go through the fun house mirror.” 

“What if it’s not that kind of mirror?” Jason asks. 

“Then we’re monster-meat,” Stacey tells him. 

The Loreo’s hot breath sears the back of your neck. In the fun house mirror, 
it appears even bigger, more terrifying. Its teeth are the size of shovels. It opens 
its mouth wide, wider. 

It’s about to bite your head off! 

“One. Two. Three. Geronimo!” you shout and dive straight into the mirror. 
Jason and Stacey are on either side of you. 

To your relief, its surface is soft and rubbery. Your arms and legs tingle as 
your body passes through. 

You hit the ground on the other side. 

THUD! THUD! Jason and Stacey land beside you. 

You’re lying on some kind of wooden platform. “Whew. We’re safe!” you 
exclaim, picking yourself up. 

Then you get a good look at Stacey. And you realize you spoke too soon. 


Go on to PAGE 24.

Get the hint? Turn back to PAGE 79.

“What’s going on?” Jason cries in panic. 

“Where’s the door?” Stacey yells. 

“Who’s there?” you demand. 

A deep voice speaks from the darkness. It asks, “Contestants, are you 
ready?” 

“What? We need help!” you exclaim. Your eyes are adjusting. But you can’t 
tell where the voice comes from. 

“The judges are ready,” the voice says, as if you hadn’t spoken. “You’re the 
most beautiful entrants we’ve ever had.” 

What’s with this guy? you wonder. Is he nuts? Is this some kind of sick joke? 
You and the twins are the weirdest-looking freaks you’ve ever laid eyes on. 

“This is a mistake!” you cry. “We didn’t enter any contest!” 

“Be quiet and look beautiful!” the voice orders. “The beauty contest is about 
to begin!” 


Step up to PAGE 103 . 




95 


Ahead of you, Jason stops so fast that you plow right into him. Then Stacey 
plows into you. The three of you sprawl on the ground in a pile. 

When you untangle yourselves, you see what made Jason stop. There’s a 
fork in the path! On the right branch, a sign says palace of mirrors. A sign on 
the left says loreo. 

“The Palace!” Stacey cries. “Let’s go!” 

You start to follow her. But then you remember something. “Wait!” you call. 
“Lots of things in this world are backward. What if the signs are backward too?” 

“I see what you mean,” Jason exclaims. “The path to the Palace might really 
be the path to the Loreo.” 

“What’s a Loreo, anyway?” asks Stacey. 

Jason shudders. “I hope we don’t find out.” 

“AROOOO!” 

“Hurry,” Stacey urges. “Pick one of the paths!” 


It’s up to you. If you think the path labeled palace of mirrors will lead 
to the Palace, turn to PAGE 109 . 

But if you think the path labeled loreo will take you to the Palace, go to 
PAGE 102. 




96 

At the very last second, Red pushes another button. Your bumper cars jerk to 
a halt. 

“Get out,” Red snarls. “And turn to face me.” 

You do as he says. Your heart is thundering. What’s he up to? 

Behind you, the elevator doors swish open. 

“Step back,” Red commands. 

You, Stacey, and Jason back into the elevator. 

Hey! There’s nothing under your feet. What happened to the floor? Too late, 
you guess the truth. 

The elevator car is missing! 

“Help!” you scream. 

A moment later, you’re falling through blackness. 


Plummet to PAGE 27. 




97 


Stacey peeks over her shoulder. “Don’t look now,” she whispers, “but there’s 
a bull behind us. And he’s grouchy.” 

Of course, you spin around at once. 

Stacey wasn’t joking. The red-and-yellow bull is the biggest you’ve ever 
seen. His gleaming horns must be two feet long. They look even bigger, because 
he’s only ten feet away. Pawing the ground. With a nasty glare in his little red 
eyes. 

“Run!” Jason screams. 

The three of you pelt across the field. Back the way you just came. 

“It’s after us,” Jason reports, glancing back. “We’ve got to move faster!” 

You pour on even more speed. But when you risk a look over your shoulder, 
you see that the furious bull is gaining on you. 

“The faster we run, the closer it gets!” Stacey gasps. 

That doesn’t make any sense, you think. 

Or does it? 


Quick! Run to PAGE 64 . 



98 

Nervously, you step into the workshop. 

Then you breathe a sigh of relief. Standing at the workbench is Professor 
Shock. He’s using a power drill to tighten some screws in his robot’s head. That 
explains the whirring noise. 

“Am I glad to see you!” you cry. You pull the remote out of your pocket. “I 
didn’t mean to take this,” you explain. “I just didn’t want you to know I broke it. 
But when I put it back together, I think something went wrong. See, I pressed the 
red button and —” 

“Wrong?” Professor Shock interrupts. “What do you mean?” 

Boy, he really is an absent-minded professor! “Uh — haven’t you noticed 
anything strange?” you ask. “Like the fact that all the machines around here are 
operating themselves?” 

“Oh, that.” Professor Shock smiles. “What’s wrong with that? That’s what 
my Universal Remote is supposed to do. It’s working perfectly! Stage One is 
complete.” 

Your mouth falls open. Stage One? You stare at the professor in horror. Is he 
completely crazy? 

“You mean ... you meant all this to happen?” you squeak. 

“Of course. Now on to Stage Two,” Professor Shock says. He tightens one 
last screw. Then he turns the robot toward you. 

“Robot!” he barks. “Bring me that remote!” 


Yikes! Hurry up and turn to PAGE 43 ! 




99 


You decide to ram Jason with your bumper car. He needs to lighten up a 
little. Maybe this will help. 

You place the remote control on the dashboard. Now both your hands are 
free for the steering wheel. 

“Here I come!” you shout and zoom toward Jason’s car. 

Jason glances up. He frowns. “Cut it out, will you?” he demands. And yanks 
his steering wheel to the right. 

You shoot past, inches from the rear of his car. Missed! 

He just doesn’t know how to have fun. You turn around in your seat. “Come 
on, Jason, be a sport,” you call. 

You wonder why Jason and Stacey are both staring at you. And why are their 
eyes so wide? 

You turn around. 

Oh, no! A huge, angry figure is standing right in front of your bumper car. 

Red! He caught up with you! 


Turn to PAGE 76. 




100 


You take a deep breath and press the rewind button. 

“Nnn ... ON!” Professor Shock screams. 

On? What does he mean? you wonder. 

But you don’t have time to puzzle it out. The robot is still after you! Its 
copper fingers reach for the Universal Remote. 

And then it steps back. Its hand falls to its side. 

It keeps walking. Backward. Back the way it came. 

“Etomer eht pu evig!” Professor Shock commands. 

Etomer eht pu evig? 

Sounds like nonsense. But there’s something familiar about it.... 

That’s when you finally get it. 

“Etomer eht pu evig” is the backward version of “Give up the remote.” 
That’s what Professor Shock ordered you to do a minute ago. 

The scene is rewinding! 

A moment later, you start to rewind, too. 

All the way back to the beginning! 


Turn back to PAGE 1. 




101 


You’re scared. But you decide it’s best to tell the truth. “We — we came for 
your mirror,” you stammer. 

“My mirror?” the Queen screeches. “Never! No one may have my mirror! I 
need it. It tells me everything!” 

“We only wanted to borrow it,” you tell her. “We wanted to look at 
something through it.” 

The Queen stares at you in silence for a moment. 

This is it, you think. I’m about to become a carving! 

She makes a horrible face. Then you realize she’s smiling! She begins to 
laugh. It sounds like a cow choking. 

“I like your honesty,” she says. “All right, I’ll give you a chance to use my 
mirror. And I’ll restore your friends. But you have to earn your chance.” 

“I’ll do whatever you say,” you tell her. 

“Not so fast!” she warns. “The task I have in mind is difficult. And if you 
fail...” She trails off and gives you that ugly smile again. “Your punishment will 
be my little surprise.” 

You gulp. Sounds risky. But your friends need you! 

“I’ll take the chance,” you tell the Queen. 


Take your chances on PAGE 126 . 




102 


You choose the path that says loreo. In this backward world, you’re sure 
you’ll find the Palace that way! 

“AROOO!” As you hurry along the left-hand path, the hideous sound grows 
fainter. You relax. Soon you’ll reach the Palace. Then, somehow, you’ll find the 
way home. 

The problem is, you aren’t getting anywhere. After walking for at least an 
hour, you’re still in the woods. You peer ahead. All you can see is — more 
woods! 

“I’m tired,” Jason complains. 

“I’m thirsty,” Stacey adds. 

You push through a tangle of leaves. And then you stop. 

“Oh, no!” Jason groans. 

“You and your bright ideas,” Stacey snaps at you. 


What’s the matter? Find out on PAGE 115. 




103 


You hear applause. “Contestant Number One!” the voice calls. A spotlight 
skewers Jason. “Turn around!” 

Jason shrugs, then turns around, showing off his weird, tall, skinny body. An 
unseen audience claps enthusiastically. 

“Number two,” the voice orders Stacey. “Smile at the crowd.” 

Stacey smiles with her tiny mouth and waves eagerly. The applause is polite. 
But it isn’t as loud as it was for Jason. 

“Number three,” the voice booms. A spotlight shines down on you. “Open 
your mouth. Show the audience your fabulous teeth.” 

You don’t know what else to do, so you obey the voice. Your mouth is so big 
your lower jaw hits the floor. The audience yells and hoots. They love you! 

“And the winner is — Contestant Number Three!” the voice declares. 

You’ve won! It’s weird, but you feel almost... proud. You wave and bow, 
blushing all over your enormous face. 

Then the stage lights go out. You can finally see the audience. They’re fun 
house freaks, just like you! Their faces and bodies are twisted and warped, 
bloated and bent. 

And every single one of them is gazing adoringly at you. 

But don’t let it give you a swelled head! 


THE END 



104 


You glance up fearfully. 

The person clutching your shoulder is Professor Shock! “I’ve been looking 
for you,” he says. 

Stacey crawls through the window. Jason is right behind her. “Professor!” 
Stacey exclaims. “What are you doing here?” 

“Were you following us?” Jason demands suspiciously. 

“Of course I was!” Professor Shock snaps. “I had to get my remote back! 
Luckily, you kids pushed the red button. That’s a homing device. Still, my robot 
and I have been chasing you all afternoon.” He scowls at you. “My robot tells 
me you threw crumbs in his eyes.” 

You remember the cookie crumbs you threw at Deep Voice. 

That was Professor Shock’s robot? 

You start to blush. “I’m sorry I caused all this trouble,” you mumble. 

“Well, there’s no serious harm done — yet,” Professor Shock replies. “Just 
give it back.” 

“I can’t,” you admit. “The cyborgs took it.” 

“Oh, no!” Professor Shock exclaims. “That’s the worst thing that could 
possibly happen!” 

Then his gaze focuses over your shoulder. He gasps. 

“I take that back,” he murmurs. “This is worse.” 


Go to PAGE 87. 




105 


“I know I’m right!” you shout. “Turn around!” 

“You’re crazy!” Jason wails. But he does what you say. 

You spin to face the bull. He’s charging straight at you. His horns look as 
sharp as shish kebab skewers. 

What if you’re wrong? 

Too late to think that way. You’ve made your choice. 

So you sprint toward the bull. The twins run on either side of you, yelling. 

You blink. Is it your imagination? 

Or is the bull a little bit farther away? 

“Yes!” you shout triumphantly. With every step you take, the bull gets 
smaller. In a minute, it’s a speck in the distance. Then it vanishes completely. 

“It worked!” Stacey cries. 

“I feel sick,” Jason groans. 

You laugh. “Let’s go find that road sign and see if we can go back home 
again!” 


Turn to PAGE 132. 




106 


“I want one of those carvings, too,” you cry and reach for a little onyx guitar. 

A single, piercing tone rings in your ears. 

Then everything becomes quiet. Very quiet. 

You try to glance around. Hey! You can’t move your head! In fact, you can’t 
move any part of your body.... 

You can feel yourself swaying. Stone walls glide past your eyes. Back and 
forth. As if you’re on a rope swing. 

Then a gust of wind spins you around. Your heart skips a beat. You’re 
staring at a life-size stone carving of a girl. A girl that looks a lot like Stacey. It 
swings from a thick chain, next to an equally large carving of a red rose. 

How’d they get a carving of Stacey? you wonder. And what about that stone 
rose? Isn’t that the same one Stacey was trying to pick? Somehow it got bigger. 
Or ... you got smaller. 

A chill runs through you. Now you realize what happened. 

You’ve become one of the carvings in the Queen’s chamber! 

You catch sight of yourself in a mirror as you swing by it. It’s true. There 
you are, in gorgeous green marble. Forever young — that’s nice. But also 
forever frozen, dangling from a chain — which is not so nice. 

Hang in there, kid! 


THE END 



107 


Now you know the secret of escaping from the mirror world. All you need to 
do is step backward through a mirror. 

You thank the Queen and rush back to the entrance hall. You and your 
friends turn your backs on the largest mirror, then step backward into it. You feel 
that strange, rubbery feeling again, like walking through Jell-O. 

The next thing you know, you’re back in Professor Shock’s garage! 

You and the twins gaze around. Everything looks normal. The mirror leans 
against the wall. The big colored switches are off. 

“Let’s get out of here!” you exclaim. 

You and the twins hurry through the front part of the garage. It’s still piled 
with junk. But you don’t feel like doing any more cleaning. You just want to get 
away from this place! 

The front door is open. You can see your bikes, right there in the yard. 

Then a dark figure looms in the doorway. 

Professor Shock! And he’s blocking your way out! 

“Oh, no you don’t!” he exclaims. “You’re not leaving now — not after what 
you’ve done!” 

He holds up a strange-looking black box with a long tube on one end. He 
aims the tube at you. “Don’t move!” he shouts. 


Go to PAGE 116. 



108 

You aren’t in the woods for long before you realize that something is wrong. 

Very wrong. 

“This doesn’t look like the path that we took before,” Stacey murmurs. “This 
path is narrower.” 

You gaze around. Stacey’s right. The path is narrower. Because the vines are 
closing in again! 

You swallow hard and keep walking. But soon there’s hardly any room to 
move. And your foot is caught on something. 

You glance down to see what it is. A thick, orange vine has wrapped itself 
around your ankle! The more you tug, the tighter it hugs. And it’s climbing your 
leg.... 

“A tree just grabbed me!” Stacey cries. “Let’s turn back!” 

“Back where?” Jason yells. “To the Loreo? Anyway, we can’t go back. We 
can barely even move!” 

The vine is past your waist now. Your mind churns frantically. Is this how it 
will end? 


Turn to PAGE 34 to find out. 




109 


You and the twins hurry down the path to the Palace. At once you hear the 
terrifying howl again: “AROOOO!” 

“Oh, no!” Stacey cries. “What’s making that awful noise?” 

“It’s following us,” Jason declares. He starts to run. You and Stacey tear 
after him. 

“AROOOOO! AROOOOOO!” 

The sound grows louder and louder. It seems to be coming from everywhere. 
It fills your head. 

“Up there!” Jason cries. He points up ahead. 

You screech to a stop as a huge shadow falls across the path. A shadow as 
tall as a building. With hundreds of arms. And thousands of grasping, twitching 
fingers. From behind the shadow, the noise thunders: “AROOOOOOO!” 

“Get down!” you whisper. “Maybe we can sneak past it.” 

You and the twins drop to your bellies and crawl along the path. Then you 
stop in shock. Now you can see what’s casting that horrifying shadow. And 
what’s making that awful sound! 


Turn to PAGE 13. 




110 


You peer into the nearest mirror. Your face gazes back at you. But no red 
dots. No dots of any color. 

You examine another mirror. Then another. And another. You see a dot! No, 
wait — that’s a freckle. 

You gaze around in despair. And then — you spy something red in a corner 
of the room. 

You rush over to the corner. Leaning against the wall is a bottle of glass 
cleaner. Next to it is a rag ... with a tiny red smudge on it. 

You pick up the rag and gaze at it in despair. 

No wonder you couldn’t find the dot. Someone cleaned all the mirrors! The 
red dot is gone! 

And you’re trapped ... forever. 

Too bad. Dot’s the way the cookie crumbles! 


THE END 



111  


“Go through there!” you shout to the twins. You push Jason through the gap 
between the tent and the ground. Then you dive for it yourself. 

The Loreo pounces, pinning you to the floor. Its mouth is so close you can 
count every one of its pointed teeth. 

“Help!” you scream. 

“Go away!” Stacey shouts. She picks up one of the nearby mirrors and 
smashes it over the Loreo’s head. 

The Loreo is stunned! Only for a moment. But that’s all the time you and 
Stacey need to squeeze through the gap. 

Behind you the Loreo screams in anger. A long tear appears in the side of the 
tent. Then another. It’s trying to claw its way out. It wants its dinner! 

You don’t wait around. The three of you run as fast as you can away from 
the woods. In just a moment, you’re back among the trees, pushing through 
vines. You’re moving toward the fork that will take you to the Palace of Mirrors. 

Or are you? 


Go on to PAGE 108. 




112 


Deep Voice looms over you, his hand outstretched. 

You gulp. Any chance you can bluff your way out of this? “Give what to 
you?” you ask, trying to sound innocent. 

“The remote control, dimwit!” Jason cries. 

“Jason!” you groan. 

“I don’t have time to explain,” Deep Voice says. “Trust me. You must give 
me Professor Shock’s remote!” 

“Maybe we should trust him,” Stacey whispers. 

You aren’t sure. Maybe it would be better to try to run. 

“Hurry! There’s no time to lose,” Deep Voice insists. 


If you give Deep Voice the remote, turn to PAGE 119 . 
If you’d rather try to run, go to PAGE 124 . 





113 


And then ... the monster robot freezes. 

Its shovel hands are only inches from your head. 

“What?” Red yells. He holds up the remote and punches buttons furiously. 

Nothing happens. 

You start to breathe again. Cautiously, you put the hose down and step out 
from under the shadow of the shovel. 

Red is still jabbing at the remote. “Arrgh! I don’t believe it!” the cyborg 
screams. He hurls the remote control down on the pavement. It smashes into a 
hundred pieces. 

Red sinks to his knees in the middle of the parking lot. “All my plans ... my 
dreams ...” he wails. “Ruined!” 

“I don’t believe it!” you say. 

The cyborg is crying like a baby! 

Professor Shock puts a hand on your shoulder. “Well done,” he tells you. 
“We’re saved!”

“Calm down!” the voice cries. 

You relax. That’s Professor Shock’s voice. And it’s his face in the mirror — 
not you as an old person. What a relief! 

“What are you doing in there?” you ask. 

“It isn’t really me,” he answers. “It’s my reflection. And it was more trouble 
than you know to get it to appear.” 

You don’t have time to chat. “Please — get us out of here!” 

“I can’t,” the professor answers. “You need the Queen’s mirror to escape.” 

“We know that!” you exclaim. “But we can’t find it!” 

“It’s in one of the Queen’s chambers,” the professor tells you. “The Queen’s 
chambers are the rooms full of stone carvings. Unfortunately, that’s the most 
dangerous part of the backward world. Be very, very careful when you —” 

You wait for the professor to finish his sentence. But his image suddenly 
begins to flicker. His lips move but you can’t hear his voice. 

“What?” you yell. “Speak up, Professor!”

You’ve emerged from the forest into a meadow. In the center stands a big, 
yellow-striped tent. A sign over the tent doorway says see the amazing loreo. 

The sign on the path wasn’t backward after all! The Palace must be the other 
way! 

“Let’s start walking back,” Jason says grumpily. 

“Wait!” Stacey exclaims. “I want to see the Loreo.” 

You’re curious yourself. “Me, too,” you tell Jason. 

You step up to the doorway of the tent. A thin man in a tall black hat holds 
up his hand to stop you. “Tickets?” he demands. 

“Where do we buy them?” you ask. 

“Buy them?” the man repeats. He laughs. “What an idea! You don’t buy 
them. I give them to you.” 

You should have guessed. It’s backward! 

The man hands each of you a ticket. “Have a seat inside,” he says. “The 
Loreo will appear shortly.” 

You step through the doorway. The inside of the tent is lined with mirrors. 
And one of them looks exactly like the mirror you came through to enter this 
backward world! 

You rush up to it. Maybe your problems are over!

You can’t believe it! After everything you’ve been through, this crazy old 
man has pulled some kind of ray gun on you! 

“We’re sorry!” you exclaim. “We know we weren’t supposed to go in the 
back room.” 

“We didn’t mean to!” Stacey adds. “Let us go!” 

“Please, don’t shoot us!” Jason begs. 

“Shoot you?” Professor Shock looks annoyed. “But you made it through the 
mirror world. No one’s ever done that! I must capture the moment! Now, just 
step into the light so I can shoot a couple of pictures. Then you can leave.” 

You’re not sure you heard correctly. Pictures? 

“You mean that’s a camera?” Stacey asks. 

“Yes,” the professor replies. “I invented it myself. It’s very special.” As he 
talks, he clicks away. “You see, once I’ve photographed you, you can step into 
the film negative and find yourself in a negative world. I’m sure you’d love it 

You’ve heard enough. “Sounds cool, Professor,” you say as you push Jason 
and Stacey toward their bikes. “But we have to go now. Maybe some other day.” 
Maybe some other lifetime! 

But as you ride away, Stacey’s already starting to say, “It might be fun. 
Maybe we should come back tomorrow....” 

“No way!” you shout. “I’ve had enough. And that’s 


THE END!” 



117 


“What’s that noise?” Jason cries. 

“I don’t know!” you whisper. 

“AROOOOO!” The sound is louder now. Closer. 

Even Stacey is scared. “Maybe we should go back,” she says. 

You stop and glance back. Thick vines have grown over the places you 
walked. The path is gone! You try to break the vines apart. But they grow back 
instantly. 

You gulp. “We’ll have to keep going,” you assert. 

“AROOOOOO/” This time the howl is so loud that the ground shakes. Your 
eyes dart around fearfully. You can’t see anything through these thick vines! 
What’s out there? 

“Come on!” Jason cries. He takes off mnning. 

Your heart thudding, you tear after him. Stacey’s right behind you. 


Quick! Dash to PAGE 95 .

The carving is of two turtles facing each other. But they aren’t ordinary 
turtles. They have human faces — angry human faces! The turtles appear to be 
arguing with each other. 

You can’t help smiling. They look like Jason and Stacey. 

Jason and Stacey! 

Your heart pounds. You examine the carving closely. The faces are your 
friends’ faces. You’re sure of it! This is what the Queen transformed your friends 
into! You’ve found them! 

But what should you do next? 

You’re tempted to slip the carving in your pocket and make a break for it. If 
you manage to escape, you’ll have the carving with you. And then, somehow, 
maybe, you’ll find a way to turn Jason and Stacey back into real, live kids. 

On the other hand, maybe you should polish the carving and hang it up. 

After all, the Queen said that if you didn’t polish all the carvings, you’d be 
punished. Who knows what her powers can do? Maybe you’d better obey her! 

Quick! Make a decision. Time is running out! 


If you pocket the turtles and make a break for it, turn to PAGE 133 . 
If you go on with your polishing, turn to PAGE 30 .

You bite your lip. “All right,” you say. “I’ll trust you.” 

Pulling out the remote, you hand it to Deep Voice. You hope you did the 
right thing. 

Deep Voice whips out a walkie-talkie. “We’re secure!” he barks into it. 

The next instant, banks of headlights flash on, blinding you. Dozens of men 
in suits pour out of parked cars. 

“What’s going on?” Stacey cries. 

“Who are you guys?” Jason demands. 

“I’m Agent Jones. We’re with the government,” Deep Voice replies. 
“Professor Shock is our top weapons designer.” He waves the remote in the air. 
“You kids have been playing with a very dangerous toy here! All I can say is, 
thank goodness we got it back before you pushed the red button.” 

Your heart thuds. “Uh, well, actually ...” you mumble. 

Agent Jones stares at you in horror. “You mean you did press the red button? 
Oh, no! When?” 

“About an hour ago.” You gulp. “Wh-what does it do?” 

Agent Jones shakes his head solemnly. “You don’t want to know. Let’s just 
say, we’re all doomed. We have only a few seconds left before 


THE END.” 



120 


In the center of the parking lot, the monster robot’s TV-screen eyes blink on. 

It’s ready. Ready to crush you! 

“What happens now?” Stacey gasps. 

“Professor Shock, tell us what to do!” you cry. 

“Help us!” Jason begs, grabbing the old man’s arm. 

“Stop that!” Professor Shock snaps. “I’m trying to think.” Closing his eyes, 
he begins to mumble to himself. 

And then he starts to snore. 

You can’t believe it! You feel like screaming. What a time for the professor 
to take a nap! 

Jason tugs your sleeve. “The professor’s too old for this. Let’s go get Uncle 
Jack,” he whispers. “He’ll know what to do.” 

You hesitate. You have to admit, it’s a bad sign that Professor Shock fell 
asleep. But still, you believe he’s a genius. Maybe this is the way he gets all his 
ideas. 

Maybe you should wait for him to wake up.

“Run!” you shout. You and the twins take off. 

“Stop!” The policeman pounds after you. 

The lake is just ahead. A blue rowboat bobs at a small dock. “Head for the 
boat!” you call. 

You reach the dock and jump into the boat. A moment later, Stacey jumps in 
after you. 

But where is Jason? 

“Help!” Jason shouts. You and Stacey glance back. 

Jason has tripped on a rock! The policeman aims a long tube at him. There’s 
a pop. Then a net sails through the air and drops over Jason. 

“I’ve got you now!” the policeman yells. 

“Untie the boat!” you instruct Stacey. “I’ll help Jason.” 

You run back to your friend. He’s struggling against the net. “Hold still!” 
you command. Grasping the net, you wrap it more tightly around Jason’s body. 

“Stop it!” Jason shrieks. “You’re making it tighter!” 

“Don’t squirm,” you tell him. Tightening the net is the only way you can 
think of to make it loose. You pull it even tighter. 

The net falls off! 

You help Jason up and start running. The policeman is right behind you. You 
jump into the boat. “Row!” you shout. 


Row to PAGE 55. 





“Get into the bumper cars!” you order the twins. 

Jason stares at you. “Are you crazy? We’re being chased by a maniac! This 
is no time for games!” he snaps. 

“I know that,” you answer impatiently. “Just get in. I have a plan.” 

Grumbling, Jason climbs into a green bumper car. You help Stacey into a 
blue one, then you jump into a red one. You pull out Professor Shock’s remote 
and start punching buttons. 

When you hit the sixth black button, the bumper cars start to move. It works 
You can control them with the remote! 

“See? We can ride these out of the mall,” you explain. 

“Cool!” Stacey says enthusiastically. 

“Nice thinking,” Jason admits. He starts to steer his car out of the ring. 

“Wait a minute,” you call. You peer through the gloom to the stairwell. No 
sign of Red yet. 

You know it’s crazy. But you’re just dying to play bumper cars one more 
time. Just once, before the mall is torn down and the Kiddie Karnival is gone 
forever. 

The question is, who should you ram?

“It’s obvious,” you declare. “We’ll go through the mirror that shows our own 
reflections. That’ll take us back to the real world.” 

“Are you sure?” Jason asks anxiously. 

You stand in front of the mirror and gaze in. Behind your three reflections is 
a familiar scene. 

“Look!” Stacey exclaims. “It’s Miller’s.” 

When you see the ice-cream store, your last doubts vanish. Miller’s is in 
your neighborhood. When you step through this mirror, you’ll practically be 
home! 

“Let’s go!” you urge and step forward. 

But as your foot moves toward the mirror, your reflected face twists in terror. 
Your reflected mouth opens as if you’re screaming. 

You feel your real face. It seems normal. Your mouth is closed. What’s going 
on? 

“Our reflections! They’re going crazy!” Jason declares. 

“Something is scaring them,” Stacey adds. Then she gasps. “Hey, look! 
They’re running away! Quick! Let’s go after them!” 

“And get caught by whatever is scaring them?” Jason scoffs. “No way! I say 
we stay right here. They’ll come back.” 

What do you think?

Thinking fast, you reach into your pocket. 

“Smart choice, kid,” Deep Voice tells you. 

“I know,” you answer — and hurl a handful of crunched-up cookie crumbs 
at his face. 

Remember? You took the cookies with you when you left your house. In 
Scout camp, they taught you that it’s always a good idea to carry a snack. 

Good thing you were paying attention that day! 

“Aaaagh! I can’t see!” Deep Voice bellows. He stumbles backward, rubbing 
his eyes. 

“Run!” you shout to Jason and Stacey. 

The three of you pelt through the garage. Enough light shines from the 
elevator to show you a staircase ahead. 

You don’t hesitate. You take off up the stairs. 


Speed on to PAGE 127 . 




125 


“We’ll wait for the Loreo,” you decide. You remember what happened last 
time you stepped through a mirror. It’s too risky to try without knowing what 
you’re doing! 

You and Jason seat yourselves. Stacey, of course, has too much energy to 
stay in one place. She wanders around the tent, peering into all the other mirrors. 

“Hey! Look at this, guys,” she calls suddenly. 

You and Jason cross to where she’s staring into a big, strange-looking mirror 
with a red frame. You peek in. 

“Cool!” you exclaim when you glimpse your reflections. 

Stacey’s head is tiny. Your head is as big as a watermelon, while your body 
is wide, fat, and very short. Jason is incredibly tall and skinny and crimped like a 
crinkle-cut french fry. 

“It’s a fun house mirror!” Jason cries. 

“Maybe we could step through it,” Stacey says, her eyes sparkling. “That 
could be really fun!” 

Before you can answer, a loud roar splits the air. It sounds as if a whole pride 
of lions is approaching! 


Go on to PAGE 130. 




126 


The Queen leads you to another, smaller room. It’s piled high with little 
stone statues. But these aren’t shiny and bright, like the ones in the big cave. 
These simply look like carved rocks. 

“These are my new carvings,” the Queen tells you. “Polish them! If you 
finish them in two hours, I’ll return your friends to their true forms. I’ll also let 
you use my mirror. But if you fail — look out!” 

You gaze at the piles of carvings in panic. There are thousands of them! 

The Queen hands you a rag and a can of wax. “Better get started,” she tells 
you, cackling. Then she leaves. 

You grab the nearest carving and start rubbing wax over it. Gradually it 
becomes a deep, glowing blue. You set it aside and grab another. 

As quickly as you can, you polish carving after carving. You rub wax on a 
stone apple, a little house, a woodpecker. All of them grow shiny and beautiful. 

But after an hour, you’ve barely even made a dent in the pile. Biting your 
lip, you pick up another carving. 

You start polishing grimly. Then you notice something very odd about the 
little statue. 


Find out what’s so odd on PAGE 118. 




127 


You and the twins race up to the third level of the mall. You glance over your 
shoulder. Whew! No sign of Deep Voice. 

You push through the fire door at the top and stop to rest. 

“Who was that guy?” Stacey pants. 

“Somebody bad,” Jason retorts. 

You stare down at the remote in your hand. Whoever Deep Voice was, he 
was desperate to get the gadget from you. Why? you wonder. All it does is turn 
things on and off. 

Or is there something else you haven’t found out? 

The twins lead you through the empty, echoing mall to a small store labeled 
jack’s electronics — repairs and sales. It’s the only store you’ve seen so far 
that isn’t boarded up. 

“This is Uncle Jack’s store,” Stacey announces. 

You walk in. The store is filled with televisions, telephones, amplifiers, and 
dozens of other machines. But there’s no one behind the counter. The silence is 
eerie. 

“Uncle Jack!” Jason calls. He ducks under the counter and vanishes into the 
back room. 

A moment later you hear a yell. 


Go to PAGE 29. 




128 


You decide to finish investigating the entrance hall before you try any doors. 
You’re turning back to rejoin the twins when someone calls your name. 

That’s funny. The voice is familiar, but it doesn’t belong to either of the 
twins. And it’s coming from nearby! 

You glance around. At first you don’t see anything. Then you spot an old, 
cracked mirror hanging by itself in a dark corner of the doorway. You peer into 
it. 

And gasp. 

A hideous, withered old face stares back at you! It’s so wrinkled you can 
hardly see its eyes. 

Your heart thunders. There’s something familiar about the face. You’ve seen 
it before. It reminds you of ... 

Could it be — you? As an old person? 

You scream. 


Go on to PAGE 114. 




129 


The spray of water hits the robot squarely in its TV-screen eyes. 

FZZZTT! The giant screens explode. Bits of glass rain down on the 
pavement. 

“All right!” You, Jason, and Stacey cheer like idiots. 

But you forgot about Red. Water won’t stop him. And you’ve just made him 
very, very angry. 

“You kids are really starting to bug me!” the cyborg bellows. “Time to deal 
with you once and for all!” 

He jabs another button on the remote control. 

And the monster robot turns toward you. 

“Help!” Jason shrieks. 

“No!” Stacey cries. 

“Spray! ” you yell at the top of your lungs. 

You aim the water at the robot’s legs. Its arms. You soak every part of its 
metal body. 

But bulldozers and steamrollers aren’t like TVs. They’re built to work in the 
rain. The monster robot keeps coming. 

One huge bulldozer shovel looms over your head. The other is poised over 
Stacey and Jason. You know you’re doomed. 

“Crush them!” Red cries. 

And then — 


Then WHAT? ? Turn to PAGE 113 to find out. 




130 


Your stomach knots. “Wh-what’s that?” you stammer. 

“I bet it’s the Loreo,” Jason predicts glumly. 

“RRRO\V\V\V\VWRRRR! ” A huge, tan beast bounds into the tent. It’s built 
like a lion, only bigger. Its toes are tipped with knifelike claws. But the thing’s 
claws aren’t nearly as scary as its face. It looks like a furry crocodile, with a 
pointed snout and sharp, jagged teeth. Hundreds of them. And they’re snapping 
at you. 

The ticket man pops his head through the doorway. “Here’s the Loreo,” he 
announces cheerfully. “Tah-dah!” 

“We’ve seen enough!” you shout. “Take it away!” 

“Sorry,” he replies. “It’s time for the Loreo’s dinner.” 

“What does it eat?” Stacey asks. 

The ticket man smiles. “Kids!” he replies. 

Stacey gulps. “Could we forget I asked?” she mutters. 

The Loreo ambles toward you, drooling. You glance around desperately. 
There’s a gap between the tent and the grass outside. Can you squeeze through 
before the Loreo pounces? Or should you try to step through the fun house 
mirror? 


Duck through the gap on PAGE 111 . 
Try the fun house mirror on PAGE 92 . 





131 


The corridor opens into a big cave. Hanging from the ceiling are hundreds of 
tiny objects. All are made of carved, polished stones. They twist and turn on 
their chains, and rainbows of colored light bounce through the huge room. 

“Cool!” Stacey cries. She rushes in. The stone objects tinkle as she passes. 
You glance up to see a tiny horse hanging on a slender silver chain. It looks just 
like a real horse. But it’s made of polished rock. 

“Look at this!” Jason shouts. He points to a tiny blue motorcycle hanging 
just inside the entrance. 

“What a beautiful flower!” Stacey gushes, pointing to a red rose. “It looks so 
real! I’m going to pick it!” 


Did you just get a piece of advice from Professor Shock? If you did, turn 
to PAGE 65. 


If you didn’t, turn to PAGE 106 . 






The sign is as far away as it ever was. But now you know how to get to it. 
“All we have to do is walk in the wrong direction,” you point out. 

“Cool! Let’s go,” Stacey says. 

In a few minutes, you reach the sign. It says: 

THE PALACE HOLDS THE KEY. 

DISCOVER THE QUEEN’S MIRROR 

AND YOU’LL SOON BE HOME FREE. 

An arrow points ahead into a thick, dark forest. 

“The Palace?” Stacey exclaims. “The Queen?” 

“Who wrote this?” you ask. “What does it mean?” 

“I think it’s for us,” Jason announces. “I think it means that the way home is 
through this Palace place.” 

Jason may be kind of timid, but he’s pretty smart. “Sounds good to me,” you 
declare. “Let’s go.” 

By walking in the opposite direction, you and the twins are soon in the 
forest. It’s a gloomy place. The trees are so thick that hardly any light can get 
through. Long, slimy, purple-leafed vines choke the path. You hear things 
moving in the bushes. 

“AROOOO!” A loud, deep sound booms somewhere up ahead. It’s a cross 
between a howl and a growl. 


Turn to PAGE 117. 




133 


Quickly, you slip the turtle carving into your pocket. You glance around. The 
room is empty — who could be watching you? Still, you can’t help feeling as 
though there are eyes on you. Hidden eyes. 

Nervously, you reach for another carving and start polishing. Better keep 
busy in case anyone comes in while you’re planning your escape. 

Then the door slams open. 

“HOW DARE YOU TRY TO STEAL MY CARVING?” the Queen rages. 
She towers over you. Her blotchy face is twisted in fury. 

“I — I didn’t mean —” you stammer. “It was just —” 

“SILENCE!” the Queen orders. “I thought you were honest. But you 
betrayed my trust!” She grabs you by the arm. “Now you’ll have to be 
punished!” 


Take your punishment on PAGE 25 . 




134 


Maybe you can turn on all the appliances in the store and distract Red! You 
pull the remote out of your pocket. 

Bad move. 

“I’ll take that!” Red says. 

Moving unbelievably quickly, he lunges at you. The remote flies out of your 
hand and skids under the counter. 

You and the twins leap toward the counter. 

Red is faster. 

He dives under the counter. A moment later he bobs to his feet. The remote 
is clutched in his hand. 

“Thanks, kids! And good-bye,” Red calls. Laughing nastily, he points the 
remote at the floor beneath your feet. 

A trap door opens up. 

You and the twins hurtle into the darkness below. 


Plunge to PAGE 27 . 




135 


You press a button with your right thumb. Nothing happens. 

For a moment, that is. 

Then a dim, blue glow fills the elevator. As it touches you, you start to tingle 
all over. 

“What’s going on?” Stacey cries. “This feels so weird!” 

“I don’t know,” you admit nervously. 

The blue light suddenly winks out. The next thing you know, the elevator 
leaps into motion. 

Sideways. 

The sudden movement knocks you off your feet. The remote flies out of 
your hand. 

“Whoa!” you yell. The elevator is traveling so fast that you’re plastered 
against the wall. You can’t move! 

“Where are we going?” Stacey cries. 

“Make it stop!” Jason screams. “Use the remote!” 

“I can’t. I dropped it!” you shout. 

Then, as suddenly as the elevator started, it stops. 

The doors slide open. Light pours in.
