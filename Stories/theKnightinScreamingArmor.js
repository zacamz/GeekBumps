`BEWARE!! 

DO NOT READ THIS BOOK FROM 
BEGINNING TO END! 

Prepare yourself to meet the Knight in Screaming Armor! 

Your cousins are coming to visit you from England. They’re bringing 
something with them. A little surprise ... 

It’s an old suit of armor from your uncle’s collection. It has a really cool 
battle-ax and a shield. And it has something else too — orders to destroy you! 

You see, there’s an ancient curse that was placed upon your family and the 
knight is here to deliver it! And that’s not all — a ghastly-looking gardener 
with three heads, Mud Slinging monsters made of goo, and some very nasty 
sheep are all headed your way! 

This scary adventure is all about you. You decide what will happen. And 
you decide how terrifying the scares will be. 

Start on PAGE 1. Then follow the instructions at the bottom of each page. 
You make the choices. 

If you make the right choices, you will defeat the Knight in Screaming 
Armor and escape its horrible curse. If you make the wrong choice ... 
BEWARE! 

SO TAKE A DEEP BREATH. CROSS YOUR FINGERS. AND TURN TO 
PAGE 1 NOW TO GIVE YOURSELF GOOSEBUMPS!

“Pip-pip! Ta-ta! Jolly good! Tallyho and all that rot!” your dad exclaims. 

“Da-a-a-d!” you plead. “Pleeeeeeease!” 

“So sorry,” he apologizes in his best British accent. “We just want your 
cousins to feel quite at home now, don’t we? It’s not every day we have 
visitors from England. It’s been over a year since we’ve seen them. Jolly 
good! Ta-ta! Pip-pip!” your dad says again. 

“Yes,” your mom adds. “Your Uncle Will is giving lectures at several 
important American museums. So Kip and Abbey will be staying with us for 
a whole week. Isn’t that terrific?” 

You only half agree. Kip Saxton is your age. Sometimes he complains too 
much. But mostly, he’s a pretty cool kid. His fifteen-year-old sister is another 
story. “Abbey acts like she’s queen of the world,” you say. “She can be a 
royal pain!” 

“Oh, you’ll have fun,” your dad assures you. “Uncle Will says Kip and 
Abbey are bringing a big surprise with them!” 

“A surprise?” you ask. “What surprise?” 


Go to PAGE 2.

Before your dad can say another word about the surprise, the doorbell 
rings. 

“They’re here!” your mom calls from the front hall. She opens the door as 
the airport shuttle van pulls away. Your cousins are standing in the doorway. 
“You haven’t changed a bit!” your mom declares as she hugs Abbey and Kip. 

“I hope that’s not true,” you mutter. Your tall blond cousin is already 
staring past you and into the mirror behind you. “Hi,” you manage to say to 
her. 

Abbey primps her long golden curls before she answers. “Oh, hi,” she 
says as she pats her hair about a hundred times. 

“Still the same old Abbey,” you have to admit. 

“Forget her,” someone says, laughing. It’s Kip. “Can you give me a hand? 
We’ve got more stuff to bring in.” Your sandy-haired cousin moves back out 
onto the front step and points to two huge wooden crates. The crates are taller 
than your dad. 

“What the —?” you start to say. 

“Artifacts!” your dad chimes in. “Uncle Will is coming here next week to 
lecture at the Medieval Museum downtown. I told him we’d store some 
exhibits here until he arrives. But I never expected anything this big! These 
crates will have to go in the garage.” 

“What’s in the crates anyway?” you ask Kip. 


Go to PAGE 3.

“Two suits of armor,” Kip says. “That’s what’s in the crates. They’re 
really old. From the fifteenth century. We call one of them the Evil Knight. 

It’s been with the Saxton family forever. The other suit was Sir Edmund 
Saxton’s. He’s our great-great-great-great ... well, you get the picture.” 

The crates are on wheels. You, Kip, Abbey, and your dad pull them down 
the driveway to the garage behind your house. You notice a label on one of 
the crates. 

“Hey, look at this,” you cry. You read the label aloud: 

“Beware this Dark and Evil Knight 
Cursed still from long ago. 

Until a Good Knight fights for right 
This Knight brings misery and woe. 

That’s kind of spooky,” you add. 

“No! Don’t read that out loud,” Kip cautions too late. “It’s an evil curse 
on the whole Saxton family!” 

“A curse?” You laugh. “You don’t believe in curses, do you?” 

“Sure I do. And so should you if you know what’s good for you,” Kip 
whispers. “I guess you’ve never heard the tale.” 


Listen to the tale on PAGE 4. 


4 

“The tale? What tale?” you ask. 



“The legend of the Curse of the Knight in Screaming Armor!” Kip 
answers. “Years ago an evil sorceress got angry at the King’s best knight, Sir 
Edmund Saxton. You know, our ancestor? He killed her favorite dragon, or 
something. Anyway, she put a curse on him — the Curse of the Knight in 
Screaming Armor! 

“She made a special suit of armor and sent it to him as a gift. The armor 
was haunted. It held the spirit of an evil knight. That night, horrible screams 
and cries were heard from Saxton castle. In the morning, Sir Edmund and all 
of his family had been killed!” 

Kip’s eyes grow wide as he goes on. “All of his family was dead except 
one son. He had been out hunting. Anyway, he kept the armor. He was too 
scared to throw it away!” 

The four of you arrive at the garage and your dad reaches down to open 
the door. 

“This is that armor. Family legend has it that one day it will wake up 
again. Thirsty for Saxton blood. Then it will destroy all that is good! Unless a 
brave and noble Saxton can defeat it. It has to be a member of the Saxton 
family.” 

“Ha!” you laugh. “I’m related to you, so I’m a Saxton. What’s an Evil 
Knight’s suit of armor going to do to me?”

The hands on the silvery-green clock move too easily when you turn them 
backward. By mistake you turn them right past one o’clock, past midnight, 
past eleven, ten, nine, eight.... In fact, they’re turning backward on their own. 
As the clock hands start to speed around the dial, Kip and Abbey start 
laughing. 

“What’s so funny?” you ask. 

“Your face is changing!” Abbey giggles and points to Kip. “You’re 
starting to look chubby. Like a chubby little baby!” 

“And Abbey’s getting shorter!” Kip laughs. “Look at her clothes. They’re 
huge on her!” Now Kip is rolling on the floor laughing. When he tries to 
stand up, he can’t. All he can do is crawl! 

With each turn of the clock’s hands you, Kip, and Abbey grow younger. “I 
want my mama!” Abbey sobs. “I want my teddy bear!” 

“I want my bottle!” Kip sniffs. 

Now they’re both crying like two hungry babies. Your mind is racing. 

You can’t take your eyes off of them and the fantastic transformation taking 
place before you. But when you happen to glance down, what you see 
horrifies you — two pudgy little hands holding on to a spinning clock dial! 
You must do something before it’s too late! Or too early! Before the clock 
takes you back to a time before you were born\

The old woman has aged and shriveled up. You act as fast as your 
withered hand will move. 

Using all the strength left in your wretched old bones, you move the black 
hands of the hot-pink clock backward. There is a rushing of wind. It feels like 
rain against your parched old skin. Slowly you, Abbey, and Kip get younger 
again. You stare at Abbey’s dried-apple face. It puffs and tightens until it is 
once again fresh and young. Kip and you are both back to your usual selves. 

When it’s all over, you turn your attention to what’s left of the Keeper of 
All Times. She’s nothing but a piece of parchment on the floor. You pick it up 
and read: 

“Time goes by and comes again, 

Time stops and goes and stops and then ... 

It’s another clue!” you shout. 

“Okay, smarty-pants, then what does it mean?” You can tell Abbey is 
really curious. 

“Well,” you think aloud, “the clock on the right turned time backward. I 
bet the clock on the left turns time forward. But what I can’t figure out is what 
this orange clock does ...” 


Turn to PAGE 68.

You slam yourself against the door at the back of the roomful of clocks. It 
won’t budge. 

“Push harder!” Abbey yells over the deafening sounds of all the clocks. 
The three of you lean your shoulders into the door and push. One more hard 
shove and it springs open! 

“Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaayyyyyyyyyyyy!!!” you all cheer together as 
you fall through the doorway and onto a long spiral slide. You hang on to 
each other. You’re speeding down some massive slide to some deeper, darker 
place. It’s as if you’re on a roller coaster into the unknown.... 

“Wheeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 
eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 
eeeeeeeeeeeeeee ....”

All this head-switching business is giving you a royal headache. And you 
still have the head of a queen! This can’t be the way it all ends. You as a 
queen, Abbey as you, and Kip as a drooling gargoyle. 

You think of the missing armor. The suit of Sir Edmund, the Good Knight. 
You think of the pieces of parchment you found — the clues along the way. 
Surely, you’re destined to find the armor. What did the parchment say? Before 
the break of day brings light, one Good shall fight one Evil Knight. If not, the 
Evil Knight will destroy all that is good. That can’t be good for you. 

RRRIIIINNGGG! Somewhere, you hear a clock strike. It sounds like it’s 
far away. And what’s that tickling your belly? 

The clock! It’s not far away, it’s under your sweatshirt! You pull it out and 
look at it. Both the green and the pink clocks say 6:00 a.m. The sun will be up 
soon! 

As if on cue, all the heads in the room start screaming! And this room has 
a lot of heads! Even Abbey and Kip, or what’s left of them, scream. Before 
the break of day brings light ... you think. You’re running out of time! 
Already you can hear the chilling laughter of the Knight in Screaming Armor 
closing in!!

“All right, all right, enough already. This is getting a little too weird for 
me,” you say. “It’s time to call the police.” 

“Chicken,” Abbey mocks you. You just ignore her. 

“But only a Saxton can break the curse,” Kip reminds you. “The police 
won’t be able to do anything.” 

“Well, I, for one, am willing to let them try.” 

You shove the good knight crate door closed and start buckling the 
leather straps. Then the loudest scream of the night fills the air. Followed by a 
crunching noise. You whirl around to look, and your heart almost leaps out of 
your chest. 

The Evil Knight has crashed one of his armored arms through the other 
wooden crate. A thick-fingered, steely, armored glove gleams in the dim light. 
And it’s gripping Abbey’s slender neck. 


Hurry! Run to PAGE 83 . 




10 

You squeal in horror and shiver as the snake’s clammy body wriggles 
down your arm and drops to the floor. Then you notice a familiar-looking 
piece of parchment speared on one of its poisonous fangs! 

You almost can’t believe it. You know you have to get that parchment. 
Carefully, you reach down. Somehow, you manage to pluck it off without 
getting bitten. The snake slithers away. 

“Hey, look what I found!” you shout and glance around for Kip and 
Abbey. But you’re all alone. Well, not quite alone. 

A chorus of hideous snarls, moans, and cackles answers you. You try to 
ignore it and read what’s on the parchment. But it’s much too dark. 

You need more light. 

The lighting is better on PAGE 36 . 




11 


You can’t trust your own head to keep Kip from being buried by a 
regiment of rolling soldier heads. Instead, you gaze around the room for 
someone more intelligent. In the farthest corner of the room you spy one 
lonely head resting on the highest shelf. 

Aha, you think. It’s on the highest shelf. It probably has the highest IQ. 

You dash to the corner. Using the other shelves as steps, you climb until 
you are even with the highest headstand. Its face is turned away from you. 
But before you can touch the head to turn it, it starts to turn on its own! It 
slowly spins and meets you eye to eye. 

IT’S THE HEAD OF THE EVIL KNIGHT!!!!!!!! 

“AAAAaaahhhh!” you scream in terror as your heads are instantly 
switched. 

It is a bone-chilling scream. 

It is the scream of the Knight in Screaming Armor! 

And that’s YOU! 


THE END 




12 

Abbey sputters as she wipes globs of thick brown mud from her mouth 
and eyes. Now she sees what you and Kip already see. The walls are alive ! 

Short, square-bodied mud beasts step out from the dirt-colored walls. 
They start flinging handfuls of thick oozing mud. 

THWAAAAPPP! A glob catches you in the ear. 

TCHWAAANNK! A fistful of the well-packed mud covers Kip’s sandy 
hair and slides down over his eyes. 

“What’s happening?!” Kip cries. 

THWAAAAAPPP! comes the answer in the form of a special delivery 
mud-o-gram. 

The oozy mud in your ear starts to harden and crack. You rip at it with 
your fingers. SKOOOOOIIIINSH! You’re caught in the stomach by another 
mud glob. It hardens on contact. It makes it difficult to breathe. You’ve got to 
get out of here! 

The Mud Slingers gang up on Abbey. They swing their gorilla arms and 
pack more solid mudballs to throw at her. “Aaahhhh!” Abbey sobs as one 
hard mudball nails her in the knee. “Why me? Why me?” she screams, 
clutching her bashed knee. 


Go to PAGE 22. 




13 

You pull the covers up over your head and try to go back to sleep. After 
all, Abbey said the story about the knight wasn’t true. 

You can’t sleep. There’s another shriek. And another. The screaming 
grows louder and more chilling. And it’s getting closer! That last one seemed 
to come from just outside your door! 

Wait. What’s that? Something is moving at the foot of your bed. You 
strain your eyes to see in the darkness. You immediately wish you hadn’t. A 
shadowy figure seems to hover at your feet, ready to attack. “It’s the knight!” 
you shout as you spring up in bed. 

Quick! Turn to PAGE 67 . 




14 

The clock under your sweatshirt is ringing wildly! Louder and louder. The 
heads on the shelves stare out at you. Rows and rows of heads with gaping 
mouths. Screaming at you. Your heart knocks against your ribs. 

Your pulse begins to race. 

“Help!” you shout. But no one hears you over the shrieking heads. You 
shut your eyes, but they’re not really yours. Your head still looks like a queen. 

Is your time up? 

That’s it, you think. Time. It strikes you, you’ve got to use the clock! 

You reach under your sweatshirt and pull out the three-faced clock. “The 
orange clock face,” you mutter to yourself. “This must be the time to use it.” 
You touch it with your finger. It’s the last thing you do. 

The green clock face moved time backward. The pink one moved it 
forward. The orange one stops it, cold. 

You always wondered how it would end. And now you know. Just like 
this, forever and ever. Looks like time’s run out for you! 


THE END 



15 

You jump back and grab your cheek where claws scraped you. You feel a 
large welt. You turn away from Abbey and grope along the wall until you find 
the light switch. CLICK. One bare bulb hanging from the ceiling floods the 
garage with a dim light. Suddenly, everything gets quiet. 

Now you see it. The monster blocking your escape route is a lawn mower. 

The sharp-nailed fingers that raked across your cheek are exactly what 
they felt like — a garden rake. 

And the snake coiled so tightly around Abbey’s legs is a hose. 

“I knew it all along,” Abbey says as she throws the hose aside. “This 
whole thing is ridiculous!” 

But it isn’t over yet. “Eeeeeeeeeeeee!” Whatever’s in the evil knight 
crate demands your attention. The crate lurches forward, knocking Abbey to 
the ground. 


Help Abbey on PAGE 131 . 




16 

The Evil Knight’s head is a steaming hunk of black metal. A sparkling 
medallion hangs around his neck. Something about his medallion holds your 
gaze. You can’t stop looking at it! With you standing there helpless before 
him, the Evil Knight raises his heavy sword and ... and ... 

He brings it down and slashes open the back of the crate behind him. The 
wood shatters like ice. 

“IN THE LAND OF SAXTONS YOU SHALL BE DESTROYED!” His 
voice booms over you. You shiver. He glances back at you and then 
disappears through the new opening. 

You’re not sure how long you stand there in shock. The next thing you 
know, Abbey and Kip are standing next to you. 

“D-d-d-did you see th-th-that?” you stammer. 

“Yeah, no big deal.” Abbey tries to sound cool. 

“Look!” Kip exclaims. “This hole in the back of the crate — there are 
hills in it!” 

“Yeah, right! What’s that mean?” Abbey huffs. 

But he’s right. You peer through the hole. You see emerald-green hills and 
a pale blue sky. You feel wind against your face. You feel yourself drawn to 
the scene. Like you were to the medallion. 

“We’d better go through,” you say without taking your eyes off the scene 
before you. “If not, we’ll never break this curse thing.” You push aside the 
splinters and step through.... 


Step out of the crate on PAGE 119 . 




17 

A pair of mud-slimed arms push out of the wall. They wrap around you, 
holding you in place. Mudballs fly at you faster and harder. 

SPLAT! Your head is covered. 

WHACK! Your arms are covered. 

TCHOOOWOK! KAAACHINK! SWAAAK! The thick sludge mud covers 
all of you. Your mud-encased body stiffens as the ooze hardens. 

Welcome to the dirty world of the Evil Knight and his army of Mud 
Slingers. They always fight dirty and they always, always win in 

THE END

“Who are you?” you ask in a cracking voice. 

“I am the Keeper of All Times — I decide whose time has come and 
whose time is passed,” the prune-faced woman cries. “You are taking too 
much of my time. Now I must take away all your time. Wither! Dust to Dust! 
Be Gone!” 

Even as she points her spell-casting finger at you, the skin on your arms 
turns papery thin with instant age. It hangs from your arms like sheets of wet 
tissue. You’re afraid it will tear! You must stop this curse of aging before you 
all end up as a pile of dust on the floor. 

“Help us?” you cry in your crackly voice. 

“Ha!” cackles the old woman. “Help you? After what you have done to 
me? Wither! Fade! Be Gone!” 

“The clock!” Kip whispers. “Use the clock!” 


While there’s still TIME, turn to PAGE 107 . 




19 

“SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!” Another shriek fills the night. Kip and 
Abbey are as wide-awake as you are. The piercing screams draw the three of 
you together at your bedside. You grab each of your cousins by the hand. 

“We have to go out to the garage and investigate,” you declare. “We have 
to find out what’s out there.” 

Another scream pierces the air. Abbey forgets how much cooler than you 
she is for a moment and clutches one of your arms. Kip grabs your other one. 
You grab a flashlight from your desk and make your way out into the night. 
You pull your cousins along behind you. Eventually, you come to the garage 
door. You pause a moment and listen to the screams. 

“Well, here goes,” you say. You reach down, grab the handle, and lift it 
open. 

Quick, turn to PAGE 113 . 




20 

You wake up. The last thing you remember is finding the piece of 
parchment that said, “Before the break of day brings light, one Good shall 
fight one Evil Knight....” 

You rub your eyes to clear the sleep out of them. You see Kip and Abbey. 
But you’re not in the garage anymore. 

A bare bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling. It casts a sickly yellow- 
brown tint over the enormous cavern of a room. The walls and ceiling are the 
color of mud. 

“At least we’re still together,” you say. 

“But where are we?” Abbey asks. “Hello! Is anybody there?” 

No one answers. 

The air is musty and stale. It reminds you of something. In fact, it’s just 
like the air in the old museum you went to on a school field trip last month. 
Then you see the muddy sign on one wall: the medieval museum. 

“Hey!” you shout excitedly. “We’re downtown. This is the museum where 
your dad is supposed to speak next week!” 

“Museum?” Abbey shoots back at you. “There’s nothing here at —” Her 
mouth is open when a great splat of mud hits her right in the face! THWACK! 


Follow this dirty business to PAGE 12 . 




21 

“WELCOME TO YOUR DOOM!” The Evil Knight roars as Kip and 
Abbey step into the darkness. 

“Go back!” you shout to your cousins. “I found the last piece of the 
puzzle. It said, 'When Evil fights and Good defends, the curse of Screaming 
Armor ends.’ But it’s no use. There’s too much evil in this place. Go back!” 

“We can’t go back!” Kip shouts. “The door closed behind us.” 

“We can’t win!” you yell. “Without Sir Edmund’s armor we don’t have a 
chance!” 

“We have to earn the armor!” Kip cries. “We have to show that we are 
brave enough to wear the armor of a knight. That’s the way the curse is 
written!” 

You know Kip is right. Only the bravest become knights. And you don’t 
know about Kip and Abbey, but you aren’t feeling too brave at the moment. 


Turn to PAGE 114. 




22 

You want to help Abbey. She’s clutching her knee in agony. But before 
you can comfort Abbey, you’ve got a new problem of your own. 

Another Mud Slinger slides out of the wall and stomps toward you. The 
broad, blubber-lipped creature is so close you can smell his oozy stench. You 
cough and sputter. 

Disgusting streams of muddy liquid ooze from his yellow eyes and flaring 
nostrils. Right behind him is another Mud Slinger. And another. And another! 

If you feel hopelessly walled-in by the mound of menacing Mud 
Slingers, turn to PAGE 55 . 

If you pull yourself out of this mud mess, turn to PAGE 86 . 





23 

There’s no way you’re waiting around to see what’s got those hedgehogs 
spooked. There’s no telling when the Evil Knight might show up again. Back 
into the hedges it is. 

“Anything’s better than facing that horrible hunk of screaming armored 
junk!” you say. But the hedges have already grown over the hole you broke 
through. 

You try pulling the thick bushes apart. Your fingers are scraped and 
swollen. “It’s no use trying to pull the hedge apart, we’ll have to try smashing 
through again.” 

You link arms and turn your backs to the high hedges. “On the count of 
three we go!” you say. “One, two, three!” All together you crash back through 
the hedge. 

You land with a THUD. The ground is awfully hard. You look around and 
discover the strangest thing yet. 


Turn to PAGE 112. 




24 

The electrical charge fuses you, Kip, and Abbey together. You can’t pull 
yourselves apart. 

With the room now the size of a walk-in closet and getting smaller by the 
second, you can barely move. Each movement causes a shower of new sparks 
to rain down over your heads. You can’t even stretch your arms up enough to 
shelter yourselves from the biting, burning sparks. 

All you can do is wait. You hope the sparks and the deadly charge surging 
through you will stop before it’s too late. 

Turn to PAGE 91. 




25 

Time is on your side. Without even thinking, you turn back the hands on 
the silvery-green clock face. You’re careful not to move them too much. 

Time goes in reverse. But only a few minutes. You watch in fascination as 
the last few minutes are rewound. Heads pop on and off until you’re all back 
to normal and you’re back where you started again. Your heads are spinning. 
Your ears are ringing. And your noses are pressed up against a wall of glass. 

You see two buttons. One says heads and the other says tales. You reach 
into your pocket and take out a coin. 

Flip a coin to help you decide which button to push. If you push 
heads, turn to PAGE 103 . 

If you push tales, turn to Page 26 . 





26 

You push the button that says tales. 

Immediately the three of you are back in your house about to hear one 
the greatest tales ever told. 


Go to PAGE 4. 




27 

Hedges are exploding out of the ground fully grown. They’re spreading 
toward you with amazing speed. You’re no match for them. They burst past 
you, blocking your path. You try to stop short. But not fast enough to avoid a 
faceful of prickles. Kip and Abbey, too. 

You start to run the other way. But you don’t get far before you come up 
against another wall of hedge! 

It doesn’t seem to matter which way you turn. Any open path is instantly 
blocked by a solid wall of high bramble bushes. 

Prickers grab at you as you run past! You shake them off and keep on 
running. You have to get out of here! The walls around you grow higher and 
higher, cutting the sky into lines of blue. 

The three of you race in every direction. But it’s no use. You stop for a 
second to catch your breath. 

The ground beneath you starts to rumble and shake. “Aaaaaaahhhhhhh!” 
you scream. You can imagine the hedge about to explode through the ground 
and up through your body! You brace yourself. 

But then it stops. It’s quiet again. Except for Kip. 

“We’re trapped!” he bellows. “What do we do now?” 


Try to escape on PAGE 78 .

“Where are you going?” Kip asks as you carefully step off your rocking 
rock and onto his. 

“Look up there,” you say. You point to the gleaming object. “I have a 
feeling whatever is up there is something we need. I don’t know why, but I 
have to find out what it is. I’m going up to get it.” 

“I’ll come with you!” Kip volunteers. 

“Stop right there,” Abbey orders. “Don’t take another step. You’re not 
leaving me alone!” 

“Oh yeah. Abbey’s afraid of heights,” Kip mumbles. 

“I’ll go by myself,” you declare. “You two stay together here.” Balancing 
on all fours, you move up onto the next rock. 

You feel as if you’re climbing on eggshells. One false move and the rock 
you’re on could crumble away. You would tumble all the way to the bottom. 
You test each rock before you move to it. It’s amazing how many of them 
have jagged edges! Higher and higher you climb. 

Then you see it. 

A hand! Sticking up out of the rocks! 


Look closer on PAGE 133. 




29 


You throw the mud beast to the ground with all your might. 
SSSKWIIISHSH-BOOOOOOM! There’s an explosion of oozy mud. Mud fills 
the air. You’re thrown to the floor. Everything goes dark. 

When you open your eyes, you see the bare bulb hanging down from the 
ceiling above you. But it’s not the bare bulb in the Medieval Museum. It’s the 
one right in your own garage! 

“Hahahahahaha ...” You hear laughter. Your heart skips a beat. Is it the 
Evil Knight? 

You sit up. It’s only Kip and Abbey. They’re sitting next to you, laughing 
and pointing at you. The two crates stand silent and still. There’s nothing 
strange going on here at all. Except for the fact that you, Kip, and Abbey are 
all safe. There’s no trace of mud anywhere. Were the Mud Slingers and the 
Evil Knight all in your imagination? 

“Did you see anything weird a moment ago?” you ask your cousins. 

“Not me,” Kip says innocently. 

“Not I,” Abbey corrects him. 

“I either, I guess,” you say. 

“Me either,” Abbey corrects you. “Don’t you know anything?” 

One thing you aren’t imagining. Abbey hasn’t changed a bit. She always 
has to have the last word in 


THE END.

Your mother always told you to “use your head.” Now’s your chance! 
Quick, before Kip loses his! 

It seems that all you have to do to switch your head in this crazy room is 
stare into the eyes of another. Without a moment to lose, you move in front of 
Queen Abbey. You look directly into her eyes and ... 

“Guards!” you shout a second later. “Return to your headstands at once!” 
Now you are the Queen with the diamond tiara and the guards must obey you! 

The rolling heads of the guards reverse their rolling direction 
immediately. Keeping their formation, they roll back to their headstands and 
plant themselves on the shelf. Kip is safe! 

All is well. Except for one little problem — Abbey has your head on, you 
look like a Queen, and Kip is a hideous, snarling gargoyle. Any idea how to 
fix this mess? Maybe, if you put your heads together, you might come up with 
something.

“He’s calling your name!” Abbey warns. “He’s after you!” 

“ABBEY!” calls the deep and dangerous-sounding voice of the Evil 
Knight. “KIP!” the voice booms again from somewhere in the next room. He 
calls your name again. 

“COME FORWARD!” the Evil Knight commands. Suddenly, you feel a 
tremendous sense of curiosity. What could this Evil Knight possibly have in 
mind for you? You feel your feet take a step forward. 

“Don’t do it. Don’t go through that door!” Abbey begs you. 

“COME FORWARD!” the Evil Knight orders again. 

If you can’t resist his command, turn to PAGE 128 . 

If you take Abbey’s advice, turn to PAGE 58 . 



32 

“Let’s go to the left,” Abbey says, pulling thorns out of her arms. “There’s 
a cottage down the hill. Maybe we can get help there.” 

“Hello? Am I the only one who thinks there’s something weird going on 
here?” you ask. Abbey and Kip can’t hear you. They’re already walking 
across the windy meadow toward the cottage. 

“Pixies!” you mumble to yourself. You take off after Kip and Abbey. 

You don’t get far when you hear a deafening rumble. It sounds like an 
earthquake! You see bits of turf flying in the air! You turn and look behind 
you to see ... 

HEDGES! Killer hedges. They’re growing at an incredible rate. Actually, 
they’re not so much growing as bursting through the earth in jagged lines. 
Walls of branches and leaves. And it looks as if, yes, they are ... heading right 
for you! 

It’s time to start sprinting again. And there’s no use screaming about it, 
either. Now’s the time to MOVE! 


Move over to PAGE 27. 



33 

“We’ll open the Good Knight crate,” you decide. You don’t want to take 
any chances. But as soon as you say this, an ear-splitting scream fills the 
garage. The Evil Knight crate starts rattling again. The armor inside clanks 
and rumbles and roars. 


You cling to Kip. Or is it Abbey? It’s hard to tell in the darkness. 

The tall Evil Knight crate rocks closer to you. It tips backward and 
forward. Backward and forward. If it falls on you, you’ll be crushed! You try 
to pull your cousins out of the way. “Let’s bail!” you yell. But you only get a 
few steps toward the garage door when something blocks your escape route. 

“A horrible beast!” Kip cries. 

“Aaaahhhh!” Abbey screams as she’s jerked away from your side. You 
accidentally drop your flashlight and it hits the concrete floor with a smack. 
“There’s something wrapped around my leg!” Abbey wails. 

“Abbey!” you shout across to her. You start to move to her side, but you 
feel sharp claws scrape across your cheek. 


Hurry! Go to PAGE 15 ! 




34 

Yes! Now you get it. It’s starting to make sense. You know you have to 
act NOW or you’ll either be fried or crushed by the walls. The electrical 
charge flowing through you is so strong you’re lit up like a lightbulb. Or like 
an X-ray. 

You stare down at your hands. You can see your bones! You dare to 
glance at Kip and Abbey. You scream in horror when you see them. They are 
electrified skeletons! 

With sparks zapping and zzztttzing every second, you pull the other piece 
of parchment back out of your pocket. These are the clues, you think. There 
has to be a way to escape! 

Before the break of day brings light, 

One Good shall fight one Evil Knight. 

Beware his deadly charge and feel 

That what is NOW is not what’s real ... 

That what is NOW is not what’s real. You think harder. That what is 
NOW is NOT WHAT’S REAL, the words scream in your head. You force 
yourself to know that what is happening NOW is not real! 


Force yourself to PAGE 57 . 




35 

Your cousins could be in trouble. Kip and Abbey could be turning to stone 
this very minute! 

“Don’t move!” you yell down. “I mean, DO move if you can. I’m coming 
down to save you!” 

You take one last glance at the shining object. Rock by rock, you 
backtrack the way you came. It’s even harder to move downward, but there’s 
no time to lose! Mostly, you try not to think about what these rocks and 
boulders used to be! 

You set your foot against what used to be someone’s shoulder. It jiggles 
under your weight. And then it flips up! You tumble headfirst down the rocky 
slope. 

“Ouch! Ooch! Eech! Ouch!” you yelp with each bump. Finally you land 
with a crash at your cousins’ feet. 


Turn to PAGE 101 to find out what’s happened to them! 




36 

The only light bright enough to read by is the firelight of the dragons’ 
breath. You inch yourself closer to that cage and hold out the jagged-edged 
piece of parchment. 

But just as you are ready to start reading, one of the dragons exhales a 
long ribbon of flame. The fire touches the parchment. It bursts into flame in 
your hands. 

You throw the paper to the ground. Just before the scrap turns to ashes 
you get one good look at it. You think it said: 

When Evil fights and Good defends 

The curse of Screaming Armor ends. 

“That sounds familiar,” you say to yourself. 

You remember what Kip told you about the curse: “The Evil Knight will 
destroy all that is good, unless a brave and noble Saxton can defeat it. It has 
to be a Saxton.” Looking around the room you know one thing for sure. The 
only good thing around here is YOU. 

You also happen to be a Saxton. 

Can you handle this much evil on your own? 

If you want to try it alone, turn to PAGE 40 . 

If you need help from your cousins, turn to PAGE 84 . 





37 

“AAAaaaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!” you scream when your fingers touch 
metal. 

“Wake up!” you hear Kip’s voice saying. 

“You’re screaming!” Abbey shakes your arm. “Wake up!” 

Your eyes flutter open. Your hand rests on the cold metal head of a shovel 
hanging on your garage wall. 

“You’ve been sleepwalking!” Kip says. “We heard you screaming so we 
ran to your bedroom. You got out of bed, put on a robe, and walked out here 
to the garage.” 

“We followed you just to make sure you were all right,” Abbey continues. 
“You walked up to the crates we brought and just stood in front of them for 
the longest time. It was weird.” 

“We tried to talk to you, but you didn’t hear us. Then you reached your 
hand out, touched the shovel, and started screaming again!” Kip is laughing 
now because of the look on your face. You’re surprised, embarrassed, and 
relieved all at once. Was it really all a crazy dream? 


Turn to PAGE 120. 


38 

“We have to free the Good Knight,” you yell over the screams and the 
heavy clanking. “Maybe it can help us fight the curse.” 

“But... but...” Kip sputters fearfully. 

“Just open the thing,” Abbey snaps, “and get it over with!” 

Your fingers fly over the buckled leather straps that hold the crate closed. 

“I’ve got this strap at the bottom,” Kip says moving in next to you. Abbey 
just watches you work. You and Kip work together to pry open one side of the 
crate. The clanking is louder than ever as the crate door slams to the floor. 

You pick up your flashlight and shine it inside. Abbey is the first to gasp. 


Turn to PAGE 50. 




39 

The silver key fits perfectly into the lock, but it won’t turn. “I don’t get 
it,” you say. “This key looks like it should go with this lock.” 

No luck. You put the key back in your pocket. You step back from the 
door to search for another way in. As soon as you move away, the door slowly 
swings open! 

“Come in,” the voice of a very old man invites from somewhere inside the 
cottage. “I’ve been waiting for you.” 

“Waiting for us?” Abbey stammers. She peers into the darkened doorway. 
“But I don’t see you,” Abbey says. 

“Come closer,” the old man says in a friendly voice. “It’s been so long 
since I had some good company.” 

The three of you step into the cottage. The door SLAMS behind you! 


If the SLAM makes you scream, turn to PAGE 87 . 
If the SLAM makes you jump, turn to PAGE 105 . 





40 

You decide you have to face the Knight in Screaming Armor one-on-one. 
If Kip and Abbey join you in this evil exhibit hall, you may all come to a 
terrible end. And these are, after all, your nightmares. 

Just as you decide not to call them, you hear Kip’s voice from the 
doorway. “Don’t come in!” you shout back. “You were right. This place is a 
torture chamber!” 

Before you can stop them, Kip and Abbey pass through the doorway and 
into the hall of horrors. “Stop!” you warn them. But it’s too late. They’re in. 

Turn to PAGE 21. 




41 

Kip and Abbey don’t notice that you are running out of the dining hall. 
They don’t care. They reach back to pull their hoods up over their vanishing 
heads. Now Kip and Abbey are chanting, too. 

“No bell tolls for us. No bell tolls for us. No bell tolls for us.” 

You race down a different set of stone stairs. A doorway at the bottom 
leads out into a courtyard. 

Across the yard is a crumbling bell tower. As you run for it, the chanting 
monks hurry close behind you. They’re not going to let you escape. They 
want you to join them, too. 

You race up the broken stone steps to the top of the tower. A rotting rope 
hangs from a black cast-iron bell. There’s a kettle full of some bubbling black 
liquid on the floor. 

You reach for the bell rope, and the ghosts stop in their tracks. They hold 
their thick sleeves up against their hoods — to where their ears would be if 
they had ears. As terrified as you are of them, they seem frightened of the 
bell! 


If you pull the rope to ring the bell, turn to PAGE 110 . 

If you decide to throw the liquid at them instead, turn to PAGE 73 . 





42 

Kip decides the right door is the door on the right. The handle turns easily 
under his hand. He pushes the door open with his shoulder and falls through. 
You grab Abbey and throw yourself through the opening just in time. The 
walls grind together behind you. They make a horrible screech like fingernails 
across a chalkboard. You cover your ears in pain but then all is silent. 

Or maybe not quite silent. As your ears become accustomed to the quiet 
you hear something. It’s a ticking. 

Tick, tock, tick, tock ... you hear. 

“Clocks!” Abbey shouts gleefully. “Hundreds of them! And they’re all 
different!” The ticking gives way to bongs and cuckoos and chimes of all 
sorts. The walls around you, the ceiling, even the doors of this new room are 
covered with clocks. Clocks of all shapes and sizes. 

A flashing sign on the wall greets you with the words: 

TAKE YOUR TIME LEAVING 

“What a relief,” you say. “At least clocks can’t hurt us.” 

“Right!” Kip agrees. “But with all of them ticking and bonging, gonging, 
and going cuckoo at once it could drive us crazy in no time!” 

“Well, that’s the one thing there isn’t any of here.” You laugh. “No time. 
Time is all we’ve got in this place!” 


Go to PAGE 81. 




43 

“Awwk! Awwk!” Abbey the Nighthawk squawks through clenched teeth. 
She carries you off into the night. You only hope she doesn’t drop the two of 
you. She’s flying really fast! 

Far below you see the bell tower and the crumbled ruins of the monastery. 
Ahead you see a giant bird’s nest resting on a rocky mountaintop. Abbey the 
Nighthawk hovers over the nest. She opens her mouth and Kip drops. Then 
she releases her claw and drops you. 

You hit the nest hard. Really hard. And before you know it, a thin white 
shell starts forming up around you. “We’re turning into eggs!” you shout to 
Kip as the shell closes over your head. 

But he can’t hear you. His shell is already closed over him. He’s trapped 
and so are you. Now all you can do is wait for the time when you will hatch. 
That could be soon. Or more than likely, it could be never. For you two eggs, 
it’s over easy. 


THE END 



44 

“Waaah! Waaah!” Abbey and Kip are sitting on the floor in a puddle of 
tears. And you’re not feeling too happy yourself! 

Your own hands have shrunken down to two pudgy little baby fists. The 
square clock now weighs a ton. You struggle not to let go. If you lose the 
clock, it’s all over! Or maybe it never began. But the clock’s as big as you are, 
now that you’re not as big as you were before! 

You rest the clock on the floor and crawl right across the silvery-green 
face. Your breath is coming in gulps now. It’s getting harder to see. Your 
hands are too weak to do the job they must do, but you’re a lot smarter than 
the average baby. 

Using your knees, you crawl forward, pushing the hands of the clock 
slowly along as you go. As you do, minute by minute, Abbey and Kip 
gradually return to their normal ages. 

As for you, you deserve all the credit. Abbey and Kip should really give 
you a great big hand! Which is what they do. 

Two great big hands scoop down and lift you up. 

“Look at the little baby,” Abbey coos. “Isn’t he cute?” 

Oh, no! What’s happening? You should all be back to normal, right? But 
Abbey’s rocking you in her enormous arms! 

This isn’t fair, you think! “WAAAAAAAA- 
AAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH! ” 


THE END 



45 

“Swim!” you call out to Kip. “Swim for your life!” 

“I can’t swim!” Kip calls back. His arms are flailing. Then he disappears 
under a wave. 

You swim as fast as you can to where Kip just was. You reach down with 
your hand and grab his shirt! 

“I’ve got you!” two voices call out at the same time. One voice is yours. 
The other is the deep and dark voice of the Knight in Screaming Armor! 

You hold Kip up by his shirt collar. He’s gasping for breath. Evil laughter 
comes from the shore of this lake. On the shore you see the tall figure of the 
Evil Knight. A black nighthawk is sitting on his armored shoulder. 

The bird flies off the Evil Knight’s shoulder. When she flies over you, the 
bird turns back into Abbey! She splashes down. “Help!” she cries. “I can’t 
swim either!” 

The Evil Knight’s laughter echoes across the lake. “I’LL SAVE YOU!” he 
bellows. “I’LL SAVE YOU ALL ... FOR ME!” 

Before your eyes the Evil Knight multiplies. Now hundreds of Evil 
Knights surround the lakeshore. It’s just a matter of time now. You’re all 
washed up! 


THE END 



46 

Aha! You have seen this clock before! What was it about this clock that 
was so strange? Oh, yes! Now you remember everything. You’ve read all 
about this weird cuckoo clock in a GOOSEBUMPS book — The Cuckoo 
Clock of Doom. 

This looks like the very same clock that got that kid Michael Webster in 
so much trouble. His dad brought it home from an antique store. He told 
Michael not to touch it. But Michael didn’t listen. Curiosity got the best of 
him — and then so did the evil clock! 

A terrible spell had been put on the clock. A strange spell. A dangerous 
spell that made Michael go backward in time. It turned him into a little kid! 

“Hmmmmmm,” you wonder, “could this really be the very same clock?” 
You can’t help wondering if that nasty little bird is still in there. 

Turn to PAGE 71. 




47 

You wake up all right. But the minute you open your eyes you know 
something is very wrong. It’s dark all around you. You have no idea where 
you are. Even if you could see, your head feels too heavy to turn and glance 
around. 

“Kip? Abbey?” you call out. 

Your own voice echoes back to you. You try to lift your hand and can’t 
budge it. You try to move your leg. You can’t. Your heart starts to race. 

“Kip! Abbey!” you yell this time. But there’s nothing. Only the feeling 
that you are trapped. Weighted down. 

Your skin feels coated with something heavy and hard. Like iron ... or 
like ... 

“A suit of armor!” you scream. 

You hear the blood rushing in your ears. Or is it laughter? 

Now you remember everything! You were feeling so sleepy. But just 
before you fell asleep, the Evil Knight’s voice filled your head. “Be all the 
evil you can be. Join my army.” 

While you slept, the Evil Knight made you one of his Evil guards! You 
will have to serve his evil wishes for the rest of your little, evil life! 


THE END 



48 

THUMP! You land on something soft. It’s a body! A human body! 

“Oomph! Please, get off me this instant!” A regal-looking boy dressed in 
tights and puffy shorts pushes you, Kip, and Abbey off of him. You all stand 
up and dust yourselves off. 

“Who are you?” you ask the boy. He looks your age. 

“I am a page,” answers the boy. “Page forty-eight in a class of one 
hundred and forty-four.” 

“A page?” Abbey asks. “What’s a page?” 

“We are knights in training,” the boy answers proudly. 

“And we’re trying to get away from a knight!” you remind Abbey. 

“Can you show us the way out of here?” Kip asks. 

Page forty-eight points to a gate that opens by itself. “That’s the way out,” 
he says. “It’s the Valley of Rocks.” 

“Hurry!” you order Abbey and Kip. “The gate is closing!” You make it 
through just as the gate crashes down behind you. You look back. Page forty- 
eight is gone. All you see before you is a night sky and a strange, mysterious 
valley full of rocks. 


Take the risky, rocky exit to PAGE 72 . 




49 

“Okay, okay. The fun’s over,” you declare. You move over to the crate 
marked evil knight and start to loosen the straps holding it shut. It’s still 
shaking a little, but the screaming has died down to a faint moan. 

“You really had me going there for a minute,” you continue. “Those 
screams sound pretty scary. And all that moaning and shaking? Wow, you 
guys are good!” 

Kip and Abbey look as if they don’t know what you’re talking about. But 
you know better. 

“Who did you get to help you with this little prank, anyway? My dad?” 
you ask. Your dad is just the sort of goofball to go in for something like this, 
too. 

You fumble with the leather straps, but you finally get them undone. By 
now you’re chuckling to yourself. It really was a good prank. Complete with 
these oversized crates. Still, you can’t believe you fell for it. 

Speaking of falling, that’s what the front door to the crate does next. It’s 
also what your lower jaw does — it falls open. You try to scream but all that 
comes out is a little whimper. 

There — in front of you — about a foot from your face — you stare into 
the laser light eyes of the Knight in Screaming Armor! 


Turn to PAGE 16 . if you DARE! 




50 

You peer into the open crate. There’s a flash of light. And then ... 

“There’s nothing in this crate!” you exclaim. “I thought you said there 
was armor in here.” 

“There was,” Abbey huffs, acting cool again. “But now it’s gone, okay?” 

“That’s impossible!” Kip argues. “This crate weighed a ton when we 
moved it in here!” 

Abbey glances back at the empty crate. “Someone must have taken the 
armor, that’s all. For crying out loud!” Oops, wrong thing to say: 
“Eeeeeeeeaaaa-hahahahaha!” The bone-chilling scream of the Evil Knight 
turns to hideous, wicked laughter. 

“It’s the curse. The Evil Knight killed Sir Edmund Saxton, and now he’s 
taken his armor!” 

“What’s next?” you say in disbelief, “... or who?” Then you see 
something. There. Resting on the floor of the crate. A jagged piece of 
parchment paper. Do you pick it up? This curse thing is seeming less and less 
silly by the second. 

If you pick the paper up and see what it says, turn to PAGE 70 . 

If you decide this whole business is too weird for your taste, and it’s time 
to close the crate back up again and call the police, turn to PAGE 9 .

The flashing eyes across the courtyard could only be one thing. The eyes 
of the Knight in Screaming Armor. 

“We can’t escape from him,” Abbey sighs. “It’s no use trying anymore. 

He brought us here. This is his world.” 

“He must want something from us, otherwise he would have destroyed us 
by now,” you point out. 

“He’s only toying with us,” Abbey says bitterly. “Like a cat plays with its 
food.” 

“It’s as if he’s using our fear of him to make us face all other possible 
fears,” Kip whispers mysteriously. 

Abbey gives Kip a double take. “Face other fears? That’s ridiculous!” she 
says. “I’m afraid of flying, but you don’t see him making me fly.” 

A strong gust of wind blows through the bell tower and rings the bell. 
BONG! BONG! BONG! You clap your hands over your ears. Kip dives for the 
pile of monks’ robes. Abbey jumps back and slams against the crumbling 
wall. The wall gives way behind her. “Help me! I’m fffff ... flying!” 

Abbey soars higher and higher. Until she’s out of sight. 

“Abbey!” Kip cries. “Come back!” 


If she doesn’t come back, soar to PAGE 92 . 
If she returns in a flash, zoom to PAGE 102 . 





53 

The bird turns right. “Where are you taking us?” you call to the black 
hawk. 

“Aawwk! Aawwk!” squawks the giant, feathered bird. 

“We shouldn’t leave this place,” Kip says worriedly. “If Abbey comes 
back she won’t know where we went.” 

“And if we stay in the bell tower,” you reason, “we won’t be there when 
she gets back anyway. That beast looked pretty hungry.” 

As the flying speed increases, the flapping of the big bird’s wings drowns 
out your voices. You fly in silence now. But you’re just as worried about 
finding Abbey as Kip is. Your worry time is cut short when you look over the 
bird’s shoulder and see a rocky side of a mountain straight ahead. 

“Look out!” you scream as the bird heads right for it. “We’re going to 
crash!” 

The bird speeds up. The mountainside is directly in your flight path. 
“Stop!” you scream with all your might. “Don’t you hear me? We’re going to 
crash!” 


Turn to PAGE 125. 




54 

You are dizzy from the heat and the force of the sword against your 
helmet. The Sorceress’s shouts are echoed by the other evil creatures in the 
dungeon. “Fight! Fight!” they all cry at once. 

“They want a fight? I’ll give them a fight!” you say. 

The Evil Knight raises his sword again and prepares to slash your suit in 
half. This is the hit that is aimed to destroy you. 

You take one heavy step backward. You raise your battle-ax high over the 
Evil Knight’s black-armored helmet. He swings his steel-bladed sword right 
at your stomach. 

Think fast! With the heavy battle-ax raised over your head, you can’t 
exactly duck! Instead, you pull your stomach back, as far as it will go. You 
turn yourself into a human question mark. 

The mighty blow of the Evil Knight scratches across your armor with a 
ring. But it doesn’t cut you. 

You still have the ax raised over your head. You lower it now with all 
your strength. CRASH! In one swift motion you bring the ax down on the 
head of your evil enemy. 

“AAAaaaaaaahhhh!” the Knight in Screaming Armor screams. But this 
time he falls to the dungeon floor. 

He lies there motionless. 


Quick! Find out if he’s still alive on PAGE 111 . 




SPLAT! 


55 


THWAAAAAT! 

SOOOWAAACK! 

The Mud Slingers throw their mud faster than you can wipe it away. 

Abbey gives up. She stands facing one muddy wall with her hands up 
over her mud-covered eyes. The monsters stand in front of her like a firing 
line. They scoop up new mud and pelt her. 

You watch in horror as the flung mud covers every inch of her clothing, 
hair, and skin. In no time Abbey is completely flattened into the mud-covered 
wall. In another second it is impossible to see where Abbey ends and the wall 
begins. She is the wall! 

“Kip!” you shout. “Kip, where are you?” 

While you were watching Abbey being mudified, Kip was being plastered 
to another wall. Only his eyes peer out at you. Then, SCHWAAAAAAP! he’s 
gone. 

You lunge toward the wall where Kip was. You scrape at the hardening 
mud. You try to say “Kip,” but all that comes out of your mouth is a burbling 
mud burp. 

SWAAAAAAAAAT! A warm mudball plasters you in the back. You fall 
face first into the wall of muck. 


Hold your breath until you get to PAGE 1 7 ! 




56 

Then it hits you. You recognize that voice! “The cottage!” you exclaim. 
“It’s the old man’s voice from the cottage.” 

Now you can see him sitting in a rocking chair. He’s hideous! He has 
THREE HEADS sprouting from his neck! And all six eyes are focused on 
you. 

“Aawwk!” a black bird screeches from a cage above you. “Aawwk!” 

The squawking bird looks familiar. There’s hardwood beneath you now, 
so you step closer to examine the bird. It reaches up with its claw and flicks 
the feathers on the back of its head. An eerie feeling comes over you. 

“It’s Abbey!” Kip shrieks. “Abbey turned into a bird!” 

The black bird screeches back at you. 

“Birds of a feather flock together,” the old man cackles as he wiggles one 
bony finger in your direction. 

That’s all it takes. Feathers burst through every pore of your skin. Your 
nose and mouth fuse together and harden. You scream, but all that comes out 
is an “Aaawwwk!” 

“Aaaawwwk!” the three of you squawk. 

“That’s it, my fine-feathered friends,” croaks the old man. “Sing for me, 
my pretties! Sing!” 

“Aaaawwk!” you all sing, which, when translated, means 


THE END 



57 

THAT WHAT IS NOW IS NOT WHAT’S REAL! you repeat in your head. 
Louder! Harder! Concentrate! THAT WHAT IS NOW IS NOT WHAT’S REAL! 

Then ... a miracle happens. 

The shrinking room starts getting bigger again. Slowly it returns to 
normal size. The lightning bolt outlines around each cousin fade to a dim 
glow and then disappear! 

“Just like the Mud Slingers,” you declare. “Another trick of our 
imaginations! This Evil Knight likes to play mind games, I’m afraid.” 

“You’re afraid!” Abbey sputters. She tries to smooth down her flyaway 
hair. “I’m terrified! I may never get my hair to curl after this!” 

As if in response to Abbey’s complaint, the only remaining door swings 
open. By itself. Out comes a voice that makes the blood curdle in your veins. 
It’s the voice of the Evil Knight. And he’s whispering your name.... 


You must answer. Go to PAGE 31. 




58 

You don’t always agree with Abbey, but this time you decide to take her 
advice. “You’re right,” you say. “Only a fool would go in there!” 

Before you can say another word, you feel yourself being pulled against 
your will. “COME FORWARD, FOOL!” the Evil Knight commands. 

“Who-o-o-o? M-m-m-me?” you stammer. 

Yes, you! Turn to PAGE 128 . 




59 

Kip decides the right door is the left one. He reaches for the handle on the 
left. When his hand is only inches from it, sparks fly off the handle. Kip 
jumps back. “Whoa! It’s electrically charged!” he cries. 

You stop holding the walls apart long enough to reach for the door handle. 
More sparks shoot into the air. A rapid-fire zapping noise crackles around 
you. It sounds like the bug zapper on the roof of the Dairy Queen on a muggy 
summer night. 

You try the door one more time. ZZZZAPPPPPPP! A charge of electrical 
current sputters and sparks first around Abbey, then around you, and finally 
around Kip. 

The three of you light up like electric lawn ornaments at Christmastime. 
Abbey’s long blond hair stands straight up. Sparks fly from each individual 
strand. She’s a human firecracker, and so are you and Kip! 

You try to turn back and escape the shock treatment, but you have no 
choices here.

Abbey rushes toward the wall of doors. She’s just about to reach the 
handle on the first door when her foot slips on something. “Another piece of 
parchment!” she cries out. 

You and Kip run to join her. She holds a jagged-edged scrap of parchment 
in her hands. It’s just like the other one you found. She reads it to you: 

“... beware his deadly charge and feel ... 

That’s it. That’s all it says.” 

“There’s got to be more,” you insist. 

“Deadly charge,” Abbey repeats. “I know about charging things. Sounds 
like someone’s going to be doing some killer shopping!” 

“Very funny,” Kip says sarcastically. 

“Maybe not to a jerk like you,” Abbey shoots back. 

“Oh, yeah?” Kip threatens. 

“Good comeback,” Abbey taunts. 

“Hey, hold it. Hold it,” you say. “We need to work together here. These 
scraps of paper are obviously meant to be clues. I’ve got a feeling they’ll lead 
us to the missing armor, if we pay attention. Until then anything could 
happen.”

Kip turns and sees the beast creeping up the stairs. “Stay still and maybe 
it won’t see us,” you whisper. 

Slowly, you and Kip press yourselves into a corner of the bell tower and 
watch the beast. You’ve never seen anything like it. 

It’s as large as the biggest lion and as black as night. It has short ears set 
back on a small doglike head. A long, swishing tail hits the crumbling wall, 
knocking stones to the ground. 

The beast growls. Rows of shiny white teeth drip with saliva. It turns its 
fierce eyes in your direction. It sniffs the air. It smells you! Along red tongue 
licks its drooling black lips. It sees you! 

“It’s going to pounce!” you cry. 

The beast jumps for you, but you jump, too. Right over the wall of the 
bell tower with Kip right behind you! 

“Oh, nooooooooo!” you both scream on your way down. 

“Aawwk! Aawwk!” you hear. A giant nighthawk passes you as you fall. 
“Aawwk!” the bird squawks again as it swoops down beneath your falling 
bodies. 


Fall down to PAGE 95. 




62 

You take the other scrap of parchment out of your pocket and try to fit the 
two pieces together. None of the edges match up. 

“Never mind that stupid puzzle!” Abbey bursts out. “I want out of here 
now!” 

Without waiting another second, Abbey runs to the other side of the room 
and tries the knob on the first door. But as she turns it, the door disappears 
and becomes solid white wall again! 

She tries the next door. Gone! 

And the next one. And the next one. And the next one. 

Gone. Gone. Gone. Right from under her hand! 

“If the doors keep disappearing, we’ll be stuck in here forever!” Kip says 
in a panic. 

“We have to get out,” you shout. “And fast! Look! These walls are closing 
in on us! We’ll be crushed!” 

Inch by inch the floor space narrows. The walls are grinding in on your 
little group. 

“Try another door, Abbey!” Kip screams, as the wall behind him pushes 
against his back. “The room is shrinking! We’ll be squashed like bugs!” 

Evil laughter booms through the shrinking room. “He’s here!” Abbey 
shrieks. “The Knight in Screaming Armor. He’s here!” 


Squeeze through to PAGE 89 . 




63 

Your hunch is right! When you hold the muddy glop up to the light, it 
disappears! You grab another Mud Slinger, hold it up, look right through it, 
and it too is gone! 

Now Kip and Abbey are snagging Mudmen, too. One by one the grubby 
gremlins are grabbed and held up to the light. Soon the whole muddy mass of 
them disappears and the walls turn white. 

You and your cousins fall in a heap on the floor. “Whew!” Kip tries to 
catch his breath. “Was that close, or what?” 

“And totally disgusting!” Abbey adds. “I appreciate a good mud facial as 
much as the next girl, but that was ridiculous.” 

“It was a pretty dirty trick.” You actually agree with Queen Abbey for a 
change. “But now what? We still haven’t found that missing armor. Do we 
just walk on out of here and go home?” 

“You said it, cousin!” Abbey’s not too worried about any missing suits of 
armor. 

“I don’t know,” Kip says. “Dad is going to go berserk when he finds out 
we lost the Sir Edmund suit! He’ll be here next week. If we don’t find it, I 
don’t want to be the one to open the door for him!” 

“Speaking of doors,” Abbey interrupts, “look over there! There’s a whole 
wall of doors. One of them has to be the way out of this stuffy room.”

Everything’s ready. The fight of the ages is about to begin. Wearing the 
armor of the Good Knight should give you courage. Instead it’s giving you a 
rash. You start to itch like crazy. I must have an allergy to silver polish, you 
think to yourself. 

You hear the wretched voice of the Sorceress echoing inside your armored 
suit. Is she casting some kind of wicked itching spell on you? 

“When spells come from a Sorceress’s kitchen 

The silver knight shall start to itchin’! 

A suit of armor will not stay 

The rash that never goes away! ” 

You rip your steel gloves off as fast as you can. You fumble at the hinge 
to your breastplate and manage to swing it open. You start to scratch but it 
doesn’t seem to help. You’re itching all over now. Just then you hear a 
horrible scream. “AAAAaaahhh!” 

“Uh-oh,” you say to yourself. “Here comes trouble!” The Evil Knight is 
here to fight. But all you can do is scratch! You might be itching for a fight, 
but it looks like this fight’s been scratched! 


THE END 



65 

You and your cousins are desperate. You’ve tried for days to find your 
way out of the maze of hedges. No luck. 

You’re weak. Tired. And, most of all, hungry. That’s when you kind of 
lose it. 

You never make it out of the hedges alive. 

And years later, your bodies are absorbed into the fertile soil. The roots of 
the hedges find you very tasty. 

Basically, you’re PLANT FOOD! 

THE END 



66 

“Aaaaaaaahhhhhhh!” You don’t know who’s screaming louder, you or the 
Evil Knight. You stare into his glowing eyes! You feel the steam of his breath 
on your face! And then he reaches out, lifts you up, and flings you over the 
mountainside. 

Down, down, down you tumble. 

Your arms and legs bash against the sharp rocks. You can feel the bumps 
and bruises starting to swell even before you reach the rocky bottom of the 
mountain. 

At last you tumble to a stop next to the motionless figures of Kip and 
Abbey. You don’t move a muscle — because you can’t. You’re stiff all over 
and you’re getting stiffen And stiffer.... And stiffer.... 

THE END 



67 

“Yeah. It’s the middle of the night to be exact,” the shadow answers. 

You recognize her voice. “Abbey!” you gasp. “What are you doing in my 
room?” 

“I heard you screaming,” she says, holding her hands over her ears. 
“Horrible, horrible screams. What’s going on here? I’m trying to get some 
sleep!” 

“Evil,” Kip whispers as he peeks through the doorway behind Abbey. 
“That’s what’s going on here.” In the dim rays of the hall night-light you see 
panic on Kip’s face. 

“Don’t be ridiculous!” Abbey scolds her brother. “The only evil going on 
here is that I’m losing my beauty sleep! This screaming simply has to stop! 
Now shut your mouth and go back to bed!” 

“It won’t stop,” Kip insists. “It’s the curse. I know it. We shouldn’t have 
brought that rusty old armor. Now we’ve woken the spirit of the Evil Knight. 
There’s no escaping it. Not for the Saxtons!” 

You don’t know about this whole curse thing. But one thing you do know. 
There’s no way you can go back to sleep and pretend you don’t hear the 
screams. The Knight in Screaming Armor cannot and will not be ignored.

The middle clock face has no hands so you can’t reset the time. You study 
this orange clock face for a moment and decide not to play with it now. 
Instead you slip the whole clock under your sweatshirt. “This might come in 
handy later,” you say to Kip and Abbey. “You never know when we might 
need more time.” 

As soon as you say the word time every clock in this clock-filled room 
strikes the hour: BONG! BONG! CUCKOO! TICKTOCK BONG! TOOK 
TICKTOCK CUCKOO! CUCKOO! BONG! BONG! BONG!!!! 

The noise is almost unbearable. You try to cover your ears, but you only 
have one hand free. It’s like the clocks are striking back! It’s like they’re 
angry at you for taking one of them! You tighten your grip on the three-faced 
clock and head for the exit door. “Let’s get out of here!” you shout to the 
others. “Hurry!” 

Turn to PAGE 7.

“Wheeeeeeee!” Abbey yells. Her hair flies out behind her as you zoom 
faster and faster down the spiraling slide. 

The force of the wind in Kip’s face pulls his cheeks back in a permanent 
smile. Faster and faster you go. Around and around. “Wheeeee!” changes to 
“Whoa!” You’re starting to feel sick. You wonder if this ride will ever end\ 

You try to keep your chin against your chest so the wind doesn’t toss your 
head back. You try to swallow so you won’t throw up. It’s almost more than 
you can take! Then you notice that the spirals are getting tighter. Two more 
vicious spins and then WHAM! You slam to a stop. 

Your head is spinning. Your ears are ringing. Your nose is pressed up 
against a wall of glass. 

“Where are we now?” Kip manages to say. You’re not sure you want to 
know the answer. But above you, you see two buttons. One says heads. The 
other says tales. 

“I guess we’ve got to choose,” you announce. 

“I’m not choosing,” Kip declares. 

“Leave me alone,” is all Abbey can say. 

You reach into your pocket and pull out a coin. 

Flip a coin to help you decide which button to push. If you push 
heads, turn to PAGE 103 .

You bend down and pick up the jagged-edged piece of parchment. There’s 
writing on it. “Hey, look what I found!” you exclaim. “It’s a note. Or a piece 
of one.” You read it: 

“Only a knight, and Saxton born 

Can break the curse that now we mourn. 

But they who wear Sir Edmund’s steel 

Must prove their courage and strength are real. 

Before the break of day brings light 

One Good shall fight one Evil Knight.... 

That’s funny. It sounds like a challenge.” 

“How boring,” Abbey complains. 

“They who wear Sir Edmund’s steel,” you read again. “What do you think 
that means?” 

“The armor,” Kip replies. “Sir Edmund’s armor.” 

“But it’s gone,” you point out. 

“That scrap of paper looks like it’s been torn from something,” Kip adds. 
“If we could find more pieces of the poem, maybe we can figure out where 
the missing armor is. It’s like a puzzle.” 

“That’s the stupidest thing I’ve ever heard,” Abbey says. Then she rubs 
her eyes. “I’m sleepy.” 

Kip yawns a big yawn. You feel it, too. An overwhelming urge to fall 
asleep. You let yourself curl up on the floor and ... 

If you wake up and are with your cousins, turn to PAGE 20 . 

If you wake up all alone, turn to PAGE 47 .

You’ve just got to know if this is the same clock as the one in the 
GOOSEBUMPS book. It was such an amazing story. You reach up to the little 
door just over the clock face. It slides open. You peer inside. 

CUCKOOOO! Out flies the most hideous bird you’ve ever seen. Is it the 
cuckoo bird of doom? You fall to the ground. You’ve got to protect your face 
from that bird! You wrap your hands so tightly across your face that you 
block out all the air. There’s a fluttering and a scraping on your skin. Seconds 
later, you black out. 

When you wake up, you don’t remember anything. You feel quite strange 
but you don’t exactly feel younger like Michael Webster was. Smaller, yes. 
But not younger. What’s happened to you? 

A steady tick, tock, tick booms through the darkness around you — 
slowly, slowly. Then a little door slides open in front of you. You rush through 
it and squawk, “Cuckoo! Cuckoo! Cuckoo!” You ruffle your feathers! “I’m a 
bird!” you screech. 

But then it’s over. That’s it. Until the next hour. 

Guess it wasn’t the cuckoo clock of doom after all. More like the cuckoo 
clock of craziness. You’re still alive, but all this noise and waiting is going to 
drive you cuckoo in 


THE END 



72 

You’ve landed in a valley. But the green hills of a moment ago are long 
gone. In fact, there isn’t a blade of grass as far as the eye can see. It’s all 
rocks. Broken up shards and boulders and stones. And it’s dark. A pale moon 
shines up above. 

Abbey tries to move and barely balances on a wobbly platform of stone. 
She shrieks, “This is like an avalanche waiting to happen!” 

“Be careful!” Kip warns. “These flat rocks aren’t as steady as they look.” 

“Yeah, uh, thanks for the tip, Kip,” Abbey says. “I think we noticed!” 

They’re right. The rock you’re standing on tips and throws you backward 
to another flat rock below. “Whoa!” you cry as your new rocky floor seesaws 
back and forth. You glance down. There are more jagged rocks waiting to 
catch you below. 

Next you look up. And something flashes. High up on the rocky point of 
this mountain, something silvery shimmers in the moonlight. It seems to be 
calling to you. What is it? 


Climb over to PAGE 28. 




73 

You let go of the rope and rush over to the kettle. If you can only lift it, 
you could throw the liquid on the ghosts. That should scatter them. 

The hooded robed figures make their way up the steps. They’re getting 
closer! You’re getting frantic. You strain against the handle of the kettle with 
all your strength. It budges a little and some of the liquid sloshes onto the 
stone floor. It pools around your foot. And you SLIP! 

You fall back, arms flailing. You knock against the bell. BONG! BONG! 
BONG! BONG! the bell tolls. 

The monks’ chant changes: “The bell tolls for us! The bell tolls for us! 

The bell tolls for us!” One by one the hooded figures slump to the floor of the 
bell tower. Soon they are nothing more than a pile of empty robes in a heap at 
your feet. 

BONG! BONG! BONG! You push the bell again. Kip and Abbey pull off 
their hoods. “You saved us!” Kip cries gratefully. 

“And those stupid ghosts are gone for good!” Abbey adds. “Can you 
believe those monks? Get a life. I mean, get a death.” 

You breathe a sigh of relief. “We’re safe now,” you say. All is still — all 
except the flashing eyes on the other side of the courtyard. 

“Uh-oh,” you say. “Those eyes can only mean one thing.” 


Turn to PAGE 52 ... if you dare. 




74 

What began as a rescue mission is now a mission to destroy you. The 
giant black nighthawk zooms upward. 

“Hang on!” you shout to Kip. He clings to one slick black feather sticking 
out from the bird’s back. 

The hawk swoops down suddenly. It’s trying to shake you off! You fly out 
to the side of the wings and your body flaps freely in the wind. “Whoooaaaa!” 
you yell. 

This roller-coaster bird ride is making your stomach do flip-flops. Kip 
looks just as airsick as you feel. But it’s not over yet. Now the hawk does 
loop-the-loops until at last you can’t hold on any longer. 

You let go. “Good-bye, Kip!” you call out as you start free-falling! 
“Good-by-y-y-y-y-y-y-e-e-e-e-e-e-e-e.” 

Turn to PAGE 117. 




75 

The hedges are behind you. The green hills are in front of you. There’s a 
warm wind in your face and something ... something is coming over those 
hills. A dark, black mist is rolling toward you. It’s already halfway to where 
you’re standing. 

“I don’t like the look of this,” Kip says. 

The warm wind picks up. Dark clouds gather. Dust whips around in 
whirlpools. Evil is in the air around you. 

“Look,” you remark, “sooner or later we’re going to have to face this Evil 
Knight. That’s the only way to break the curse, right? Only a Saxton can 
defeat him!” 

“I’d prefer later to sooner —” Kip starts to answer back. He never finishes 
his sentence. 

“SCREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!” The scream of 
the Evil Knight announces his arrival. 


Find out what happens next on PAGE 85 ! 




76 

You read the words of the new puzzle piece again: “That what is NOW is 
not what’s real.” You don’t know what this means yet, but you do know you 
have to get out of this room NOW! 

“Zzzzt?” Kip sparks. 

“Zzzt zzzztttz zzt?” Abbey adds. 

They think you have figured something out. They want to know what is 
happening NOW. You cannot answer NOW, because you understand what this 
puzzle piece means. There never is a NOW. As soon as NOW comes, it 
becomes THEN. In the split second that is NOW you know one thing, there is 
no escaping this place NOW. There is no NOW. Just as you are about to 
escape NOW, NOW is THEN and your chances of leaving are gone. 

You and Kip and Abbey are stuck in the never-land of NOW. The awful 
truth is closing in on you and so are the walls. What is NOW is not what’s 
real. But what is real is that for you and Kip and Abbey, NOW is 


THE END. 



77 

The voice is soft. “Come in,” it says again. You stand up, feeling dizzy 
from floating. You fall forward through the door. You’re in. The door closes 
softly behind you. You breathe a sigh of relief until a steel barred gate 
CRASHES down over the door! 

“AAAAAaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!” the scream of the Evil Knight rings out. 
“WELCOME TO MY KNIGHT-MARE!” he bellows. 

You turn your head left, then right. “This isn’t a cottage!” you cry. “It’s a 
dungeon!” 

Giant black rats scurry over your feet. Longhaired poisonous spiders 
scamper across their webs to hang down in your face. Heads without bodies 
float through the air. Clocks without hands scream out Cuckoo cuckoo! A 
Mud Slinging monster throws a glob of gooey stuff at you. You duck just in 
time. THWACK! It splatters against a stone wall. 

Lightning bolts zap and zzzzttt in the air above you. Vampire bats fly 
blindly through the iron bars of the gate behind you. No, this is not a cottage. 
This is a Den of Danger! A Hall of Horrors! An Alcove of Evil! The Final 
Frontier!

You stare at the walls of greenery surrounding you. “The hedges are too 
high,” you say. “We can’t climb over them.” 

“It looks like a maze,” Abbey comments. “You know, Kip, like they used 
to have at royal palaces and stuff? I wonder if there’s a way out.” 

“We’ll either have to find our way out or break through the hedge. We 
can’t stay in here forever,” you say. 

“Forever!” Kip wails. 

“Knock it off, Kip!” you and Abbey both cry. 

So what will it be?

If you try to break through the hedge instead, turn to PAGE 116 .

Where the queen’s head was, Abbey’s head now rests. On Abbey’s neck 
the queen’s head straightens itself and stares right at you! The new Queen 
Abbey stands peering at the glass door trying to catch her own reflection. 

Kip hasn’t noticed what’s happened to Abbey yet. He’s busy making faces 
at a hideous gargoyle head along the wall. The grotesque, bald, wide¬ 
mouthed, bulging-eyed head is the ugliest head in the room. 

“A face only a mother could love,” Kip jokes, gazing into the monster’s 
beady little eyes. In a flash, the gargoyle head changes places with Kip’s! 

You watch in stunned amazement as Kip, the Gargoyle, turns on Abbey, 
the Queen. “Argh!” says Kip. 

“Aahhh!” the startled Queen Abbey screams. “Guards! Off with his head! 
Off with his head!” 

A whole row of Royal Guard heads springs to life. The helmeted sentries 
cry out from their stands, “Save the Queen! Save the Queen!” With one quick 
motion the whole row of guards’ heads tips forward and rolls onto the floor. 
They regroup into formation and start rolling full force toward Kip! In 
seconds he’ll be buried in heads!

The Good Knight’s armor has armed you with more than a battle-ax and 
shield. It’s armed you with courage. This dungeon doesn’t scare you. “Show 
your face, Evil Knight!” you shout bravely. You don’t have to wait long. 

A giant figure steps out of the sickly yellow light. It is the Evil Knight! He 
is taller, darker, and scarier than ever. His eyes shoot flames at you. The 
flames hit your silver armor and heat it up on contact. His eyes fire at you 
again! Sweat pours down your face and neck. Inside the armor barbecue pit, 
you’re melting! 

The Evil Knight laughs as he raises his sword and swings it hard against 
your helmet. The vibrations from the metal-on-metal make your whole body 
shake. The Evil Knight swings again and hits you on the other side of your 
helmet. You’re too stunned to move. 

“Fight!” someone screams. It’s the Sorceress. The same one who created 
the Evil Knight and watched him defeat Sir Edmund Saxton. She’s been 
waiting centuries for another showdown. “Fight!” she screams again. “Fight! 
Fight! Fight!” 


Take a deep breath and go to PAGE 54 .

“Look at this one!” Abbey calls out. She’s pointing to an antique cuckoo 
clock standing on the floor in a corner. 

The clock is mostly black. But its designs are painted with silver, gold, 
and blue, and it’s decorated with scrolls, carvings, knobs, and buttons. It has a 
white face and gold hands and numbers. 

You glance at the clock and feel an odd sense of doom about it. You 
wouldn’t be at all surprised if the door opened up and a hideous bird flew out! 
Something about this clock looks strangely familiar to you. Where have you 
seen it before? 

If you think you know where you’ve seen this clock before, turn to 
PAGE 46 . 

If another clock hanging on the wall next to this one catches your eye,

You run to where the cottage is, but it’s no longer there! Those nasty 
pixies keep moving it. 

“Over here!” the pixies giggle. 

“Over there!” 

“Over here!” 

“Over there!” 

“Over here!” 

“Over there!”

“Abbey!” Kip cries as he watches his sister twist in the grasp of the Evil 
Knight. 

“Help me!” Abbey cries in terror. 

CRASH! The Evil Knight’s other armored arm rips through the wooden 
slats of the crate and wraps around Abbey’s body. You and Kip scream in a 
harmony of horror. Any hopes you had of helping Abbey vanish as the Knight 
continues crashing through his wooden prison. Nothing can stop him now! 

He’s going to destroy all that is good — and that means YOU! 

Cover your eyes. Don’t look. This is going to be too terrible to watch. 

Evil spelled backwards is LIVE, which is one thing you won’t be when the 
Knight in Screaming Armor is done with you! 

THE END 

Or is it the end really? If you think it’s too early to exit this adventure, 
go to PAGE 99 .

You decide you need all the help you can get. Kip and Abbey are just on 
the other side of that door, you think. 

You turn back toward the door. As if in answer to your thoughts, a huge 
iron grating slams into the ground in front of you. Another sheet of metal 
slams down in front of the grating. 

“Kip! Abbey!” you call to them. Then all the monsters from your 
nightmares start rattling their cages. 

“You’ll never win!” the warty women sing out together. “You cannot win 
without the Good Knight’s armor. Evil is as Evil does and Evil does do evil!” 
They cackle in their cages, taunting you with their wicked words. 

You force yourself not to listen to them. You know what you have to do 
now. You’ll have to stand firmly and fight the Evil Knight on your own. 

“Show your face, Evil Knight!” you call out. 

The dragon spews a stream of fire, lighting the darkest corners of the Hall 
of Evil. Still you see no Evil Knight. 

“Show your face, Evil Knight!” you shout again. 


Don’t lose your courage now. Turn to PAGE 118 . 




85 

The Evil Knight’s screams mingle with the whistling blast of hot wind. 
You can almost feel his evil breath mixed in with the wind. You know he’s so 
close. The dark mist rushes at you! 

The force of the gale throws the three of you backwards against the 
hedge. But you don’t feel the prickly leaves. You don’t land on the ground 
where you were before. In fact, you don’t land at all! 

“We’re faaaaaaaaaaaaaaalling!” the three of you cry together. Falling! 

Falling! 

Falling!

There’s no way you’re going to just stand here and be mudified by a tribe 
of mud-slinging mud monsters! 

“Come on!” you shout. You duck a far-flung mud pie aimed right for your 
face. “We’re getting out of here!” 

“Which way is out?” Abbey cries. She throws her hands up and blocks a 
blob of ooze. As she blocks the blob, you notice the light from the bare bulb 
swinging right through the Mud Slinger! 

Suddenly, an idea clicks in your mind. “I’ve got a hunch this is just one 
big dirty trick being played on us by the Evil Knight,” you guess. “These Mud 
Slingers aren’t real. They’ve been planted in our minds by the powers of the 
Knight. The light shines right through them. Watch!” 

You reach for the biggest, muddiest mass of glop and grab it by the neck. 
Your hands sink down into his shoulders. Still you manage to lift the barrel¬ 
bodied beast up over your head.

You can’t help it. The SLAM of the door makes you scream. 

“We didn’t mean to scare you.” It’s the old man’s voice. 

“We?” you ask. “Did you say we?” 

To answer your question, the old guy hobbles forward. You see his dusty 
boots emerge from the shadows. A pair of ragged canvas pants and a cardigan 
sweater with holes appear. Then you see his face. 

Talk about U-G-L-Y! He cackles as he glares at you from a wrinkled, 
mole-covered face. This guy must be a hundred years old. And he’s looking at 
you funny. 

Then something catches your eye. Something next to his grizzled old ear. 
IT’S ANOTHER HEAD! A horrible, wart-covered, puffy-eyed head with a 
squirming, dangling tongue! It’s sticking out from the right side of his neck! 

You hear Abbey squealing in terror. 

And there’s ANOTHER HEAD! On the other side! Sticking out from his 
neck. As this one catches the light you see a mouthful of slimy rotting teeth. 
His bloodshot eyes roll around out of control! 

“We didn’t mean to scare you,” the old man says. “WE MEANT TO 
TERRIFY YOU!”

“No bell tolls for us. No bell tolls for us. No bell tolls for us.” Kip’s and 
Abbey’s voices rise above the others. 

You gaze into their transparent eyes and catch a glimpse of your own 
reflection. 

Under the hood of your robe there’s NO FACE AT ALL! 

“No bell tolls for us! No bell tolls for us!” you hear yourself say. “No bell 
tolls for us.” 

Face it — you’re a dead ringer until 


THE END

You can’t see the Evil Knight, but you know he’s here somewhere. His 
hideous laughter turns to screams and back to laughter again. This shrinking 
room is a tiny torture chamber. And it’s getting tinier by the second. 

You brace yourself against one of the advancing walls in a frantic attempt 
to hold it back. You strain against it with all of your strength. 
“Aaaaaaaaaaaah!” you yell as your muscles begin to burn and ache. “Try 
another door, Abbey!” you gasp out. “Quick!” But Abbey is paralyzed with 
fear. She doesn’t move a muscle. 

Your ear is pushed up against the crushing wall. There is a terrible 
grinding sound behind it. Your feet start to skid and slip. 

“The door, Kip! The door!” you scream. 

“But there are two doors left,” Kip cries. “Which door should I open?” 

“The right one!” you yell back. “Open the right one!” 


If the door on the right is the right one, turn to PAGE 42 .

“WELCOME TO MY MUSEUM!” roars the voice of the Evil Knight as 
you enter the mysterious dark room. “MY VERY OWN MID-EWL 
MUSEUM OF EVIL KNIGHT-MARES ! ” He bursts into laughter at his own 
joke. His horrifying laughter mocks you. It seems to come from every 
direction. 

You spin around, peering into the darkness for any sign of the Knight. 
“Where are you?” you shout over the chorus of evil sounds. “Show your 
face!” 

“AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH! ” An ear-piercing screech. 
The Knight in Screaming Armor reminds you who’s in charge here. Suddenly, 
you don’t feel so curious anymore. 

A dim light seems to come from somewhere. Or maybe it’s just that your 
eyes grow accustomed to the dark. But all around you vertical lines seem to 
emerge from the blackness. They’re bars. Iron bars. They’re CAGES! But 
they’re not your cage. At least, not yet. 

It’s a kind of museum exhibit. Or maybe a zoo. A zoo of evil. You shake 
with terror when you see what’s inside all those cages. 


See what’s in the cages on PAGE 106 . 




91 

“Zzzzt! Zzzztl Zzzt zzzt zzttt!” You try to speak, but the only thing coming 
out of your mouth are sparks! 

“Zzzzt zzzt!” Abbey adds her two sparks. 

“Zzzzzzzzt! Zzzzzzzt!” Kip sparks loudest of all. He’s holding up the 
second piece of parchment with the warning about “his deadly charge.” 

If you could talk you would remind Kip — you already saw that piece of 
the puzzle. You figure that this electrically charged state you’re all in is what 
the piece of parchment warned about. 

Kip waves the parchment at you. “Zzzzt zt!” he says. 

“Zzt zzzzt!” you agree. Sure you’ll take another look at the piece of 
parchment. You try to see through all the sparks to what is written there. 
Here’s the real shocker — new words have appeared! You read to yourself: 

... beware his deadly charge and feel 

That what is NOW is not what’s real. 

Aha! Now you get it! 

If what you get is what you see, turn to PAGE 34 . 

If what you get is what you wish you never saw, turn to PAGE 76 . 





92 

“Kip! Kip!” Abbey’s voice is so far away now, you can hardly hear her. 

“Wow! She’s really flying!” you say in amazement. “You must be right 
about the fear thing, Kip.” 

“Come back!” Kip calls up to the night sky. 

But Abbey’s growing smaller and smaller against the night sky. And in 
another moment, she’s gone. You almost can’t believe it. Just like that. Gone. 

Kip starts to sob. 

You try to be brave. “We’ll find her again. I know we will,” you say. 
“We’ve come this far together. Through all this craziness.” 

A low growl from the stone stairs lets you know there’s more craziness to 
come. “Who’s there?” you demand. 

“Aaaaaahhhhhhhhhhhh!” The Evil Knight’s scream echoes out across the 
courtyard. 

The growl on the stairs turns to a howl answering the scream of the 
Knight! Then, a huge, black catlike creature with yellow eyes appears around 
the bend in the stairs. 

“Kip. Over there,” you say as quietly as you can. 


Turn to PAGE 61.

The antique cuckoo clock in the corner is strange. But it’s nothing 
compared to the clock hanging on the wall next to it! “This clock looks like 
something from the future,” you say to Kip and Abbey. 

“It’s pretty. Like me,” Abbey declares. “I’m taking it down to get a closer 
look.” She stands on tiptoe and lifts the square clock down. You all gather 
around to see. The shimmering, silver, hologram clock face has three smaller 
clock faces on it. One face is silvery-green with wavy silver hands. One is hot 
pink with straight black hands. The last one’s fiery orange with no hands at 
all. 

“They’re set at different times,” you notice. You check your watch. It’s 
1:00 a.m. You decide to reset the funny clock faces to the correct time.

There are hedgehogs squirming all over you. They jabber away: “ Chitter 
... chee chee chitter chirt ... chim chitter cheech.” 

“They’re talking to each other!” you mutter through a mouthful of 
hedgehog spines. Two hedgehogs are holding a meeting right on your face. It 
doesn’t feel very good. You manage to sit up. Dozens of the balled-up 
hedgehogs roll off you then pounce on you again. 

“Chirt cheett churnchit cheeeet!” the lead hedgehog squeals. Three 
hedgehogs nesting in Abbey’s hair look up. 

The ones on Kip’s shoulders curl into balls and roll down his chest. Spiny 
fur balls roll out of your sleeves, off your head, out of Abbey’s hair, and even 
out from inside your shoes! 

“Chirt cheett churnchit cheeeet!” the biggest hedgehog says again. In a 
flash, they scurry back into the hedges behind you. 

What’s going on? You feel a blast of wind. It’s warm, not cold. You raise 
your eyes up to the hills. A dark mist is rolling down over them. 

“Hey,” you say. “We’d better get out of here. Whatever that mist is, those 
little animals were scared of it.” 

“Where are we going to go?” Abbey asks. 


If you return to the hedges, turn to PAGE 23 . 

If you wait where you are to see what’s coming, turn to PAGE 75 . 





95 

You’re falling fast, but not fast enough to escape hot drool dripping from 
the beast’s mouth. The beast leans over the edge of the bell tower wall. You 
get a faceful of steaming spit. Before the next big loogie hits you, the giant 
nighthawk flies under you and Kip. It catches you on its back and swoops 
upward. 

You don’t know where this black bird of night is taking you. As you look 
back at the beast you know one thing for sure: Wherever you’re going has got 
to be better than where you’ve just been! 

If the bird turns left, turn to PAGE 115 .

“You can just forget that Screaming Armor story!” Abbey snaps before 
Kip gets a chance to answer you. “It’s totally stupid and it’s not even true.” 

But long after everyone has gone to sleep, you lie awake thinking about 
the crates in your garage. 

Hours later, you’ve just dozed off when you are awakened by a chilling 
scream — and it’s coming from the garage. 

“The curse!” you gasp. 

If you try to ignore the scream, turn to PAGE 13 . 

If you investigate the chilling shriek, turn to PAGE 19 . 





97 

Led by the Evil Knight, the whole herd of sheep stampedes! Terror grips 
you, as the thundering herd bears down on the three of you. You are about to 
be trampled! 

The stampede sounds like a sonic boom. You wrap your arms around your 
head and wait to feel the pain of a hundred little hooves pounding you into the 
grass. So this is how he plans to destroy us, you think. You open your mouth 
to scream, but you can’t hear anything over the thundering of sheep feet. 

Then, suddenly, there’s nothing but the sound of screaming. Your own 
screaming. You peek through your arms. 

The stampeding herd is gone. The hills are gone. All that’s left are prickle 
bushes. You’re buried in prickle bushes. And they hurt! 

Turn to PAGE 132. 




98 

Leaving the three-faced monster behind, the three of you lunge for the 
back door of the cottage. “Locked again!” you cry, shaking the handle 
furiously. 

“The key!” Kip reminds you. “Try the key!” 

You fumble in your pocket, pull out the key, and put it in the lock. Just as 
you feel the key start to turn, you hear the monster trio chanting a series of 
mumbo-jumbo words: 

“Sliziwick, whizaslick, haggedly zee. 

Make three into one with the turn of the key!” 

The key turns. The door opens. The three of you push against each other 
trying to be the first one out. 

You push. Kip pushes harder. Abbey pushes hardest! She pushes too hard. 

The monster’s spell has worked. All that pushing squashes your bodies 
together into one. 

POP! You fall outside. 

But the turn of the key has made you a three-faced, one-bodied monster 
just like the old man! All you know is two heads may be better than one, but 
three heads add up to one big headache! 


THE END 



99 

“The end?” you challenge. “In your dreams, you hunk of junk! You won’t 
get rid of us so fast.” 

Much to your cousins’ surprise, you spring into action. You reach past the 
Knight to a shelf on the garage wall. You grab a can of motor oil and flip open 
the pop-top. You pour it over the armored arms that hold Abbey in a deadly 
grip. 

“Aahh!” Abbey shrieks as the oily liquid covers her head. But thanks to 
the oil, she slides right through the circling arms of iron. She’s free! 

Now you can get back to the business of closing up the evil knight crate. 
The three of you grab hammers, nails, and ropes from the garage work-bench. 
The Evil Knight’s arms flail about. They’re covered in the thick goopy oil. 
You hurry to seal up the wooden crate again. 

It feels great to be back in control of things again. But the feeling doesn’t 
last. Now the crate marked good knight is rattling. A white light pierces right 
through the wood slats and zooms in on you, almost blinding you. The door 
pops open, ripping the leather straps. A vision of a knight, a knight in shining 
armor, fills your view. You squint and shield your eyes with your hands. The 
face on the knight is YOUR face! 

The bright light fades away. You’re left staring into the crate at a floating 
piece of parchment. 


Pick it up on PAGE 70 .

“Let’s go to the right,” Kip says as he pulls prickles from his arms and 
legs. “I don’t like the looks of that cottage over there. Why would anyone live 
out here in the middle of nowhere?” 

A pixie giggles and the cottage disappears! “Now it’s over here, not over 
there!” The pixie laughs. “Do you like it over here?” The cottage magically 
appears behind you. “Or do you like it over here?” Another pixie giggles as 
the cottage turns up on your left. 

“Over here. Over there. It doesn’t really matter where,” the two pixies 
sing together. “Where you are is where you’re not, when a pixie’s spell 
you’ve got!” 

“You should take the chance to hide,” one sings, pointing to the magic 
cottage. “The Wicked One won’t look inside,” the other one sings. 

The sudden shrill shriek of the Evil Knight sets your feet running. “If the 
Evil Knight destroys us before we can break the curse, no Saxton will ever be 
safe,” you pant as you run. “He’s coming. Hurry! We have to go hide in that 
cottage over there. Like it or not!” 


Run to the cottage on PAGE 82 . 




101 

You lie there among the rocks for a moment. Your head is still spinning 
from your fall. 

“Are you all right?” Abbey asks. 

“We saw the whole thing!” Kip says with admiration. “I give it a perfect 
ten. You were fantastic!” 

“I thought you were turning to stone!” you sputter. 

“Ha! That’s a good one.” Abbey laughs. “We were just trying to keep still. 
We didn’t want to start an avalanche while you were up there.” 

“Yeah,” Kip explains. “It’s just like with snow. The slightest movement or 
sound might bring everything tumbling down.” 

That’s it. An avalanche. “Kip, you’re a genius!” you exclaim. 

“I am?” 

“He is?” Abbey looks amazed. 

“An avalanche. That’s the way to get that shimmering thing. It will help 
us. I just know it. And if not, maybe an avalanche can help us get out of this 
horrible place,” you explain. 

Before they can stop you, you pick up a good-sized rock and throw it as 
far as you can up the slope. 

Pieces of rock start to cascade down the rock face. You, Kip, and Abbey 
scramble to the edge of the slope out of the way. 


Scramble over to PAGE 121. 




102 

In a flash, Abbey is back. But she’s not Abbey anymore. At least not most 
of her. It’s her head — complete with long blond hair — on the body of a 
gigantic black bird. Nighthawk Abbey swoops down from the black night sky. 
“Awwk! Awwk!” she squawks. She flaps her wings and dive-bombs you and 
Kip. 

“Duck!” you shout to Kip. 

“Hawk!” Abbey screeches from above. Then she swoops down on you 
again. 

You hear the flapping of her giant wings as she flies by your head and 
digs her sharp claws into your skull. You scream out in pain! 

Without stopping she turns in midair and attacks Kip with the same skull¬ 
cracking force. 

“Abbey! Abbey! It’s me!” Kip pleads. “Don’t do this!” Abbey circles, 
ready for another attack. 

“Ring the bell!” you shout to Kip. “Maybe the noise will scare her away!” 

Kip reaches his hand up for the side of the bell. His fingers just miss it as 
Abbey the Nighthawk flies between the bell and his hand. She opens her 
mouth and closes it tightly on the back of his shirt. With Kip dangling from 
her teeth, she swoops down over you and grips your shirt with her hawk 
claws. 


Get carried away to PAGE 43 . 




103 

Your coin landed on heads, so heads it is. You push the button. The glass 
wall slides open to a low-ceilinged room. A sign above the door warns you to 

WATCH YOUR HEAD. 

You duck down slightly as you enter a room with rows and rows of 
shelves lined with heads from medieval times! There are women’s heads, 
men’s heads, and even weird heads of beasts. 

“How strange!” Abbey gasps. 

“They look so real,” Kip says. He’s pretty scared. 

“They’re just mannequin heads.” You laugh a little nervously. “Probably 
the museum uses them in exhibits to model old hats and stuff.” 

“You might be right,” Abbey says as she walks along one of the rows of 
heads. She stops in front of one of them. She smiles. It looks like the head of 
a queen. “Now here’s something I could get into. Check out the diamonds on 
that tiara. I wouldn’t mind modeling that myself!” 

What you see next makes your eyes bulge. 

“Abbey!” you sputter. “What happened?” 


Follow Abbey’s head to PAGE 79 . 




104 

“It’s no use,” Abbey complains breathlessly after running first one way 
and then the other. “The cottage is never where it seems to be. I’m too tired to 
run anymore.” 

“So am I,” Kip says, collapsing on the ground next to his sister. “We’ll 
just have to take our chances with the Knight in Screaming Armor. I need 
some sleep.” 

“No! We can’t sleep!” you say. “I’m tired, too, but if we sleep, the Evil 
Knight will destroy us.” 

Everything is quiet now. You fight sleep. Abbey and Kip fight it, too, but 
you can see they are losing. They both fall into a deep sleep. 

Only you are awake to stand guard. A cloud rolls over the moon. It’s 
impossible to see anything. Behind you a crackling of underbrush signals a 
footstep. 

“Who goes there?” you shout into the darkness. 

No answer. 

The footsteps crush the brush again. You hear breathing. Closer. Closer. 
Slowly, you reach a hand out in front of you. In total darkness your fingers 
touch ... metal! 


Go to PAGE 37. 




105 

The loud SLAM of the door startles you. You jump two feet into the air. 
When you come back down, the floor beneath you opens up. 

“Atrapdoooooooor!” you exclaim. The three of you plunge downward. It 
seems like you’re falling for a while. Then your luck changes. You land on a 
soft bed covered with brown cloth. 

“Whew!” you sigh, catching your breath. “I don’t know where we are. 

But am I glad to be away from that old guy. I can’t explain it, but his voice 
really gave me the creeps!” 

“I keep telling Abbey the same thing,” Kip teases. “I can’t explain it, but 
her face really gives me the creeps.” 

“Don’t push your luck, Kip,” Abbey warns, and she whacks him with a 
piece of brown cloth. 

“What are these, anyway?” Kip asks. He lifts up the coarse brown sheet 
that just hit his face. 

“They’re monks’ robes!” Abbey answers. “See?” She puts one on over 
her head. She looks just like a monk in a movie. 

“Cool!” You and Kip try them on, too, just for fun. “What are they doing 
in this old guy’s basement?” 

“Shhhh!” Abbey hushes you. “Listen!” 

The sound of low chanting comes from somewhere above you. “Do you 
think it’s the Knight in Screaming Armor?” you ask. “It sounds more like 
singing than moaning.” 


Tiptoe to PAGE 123 . 




106 

You gasp. All around you, cages hold hideous mutant faces and 
monstrous shapes. Something about them looks strangely familiar, too. Then 
you realize — the Evil Knight has gathered together all of the most terrifying 
creatures FROM YOUR OWN WORST NIGHTMARES! 

To the right — there behind those bars — looms a hulking purple mound 
of slime. It has two enormous, watery, yellow eyes and it’s sweating snails! 
They pop out of its skin and crawl toward you! “Oh, gross!” you hear yourself 
say. 

Just to your left is the dark and silent outline of an executioner with a 
broad, flat ax. Without thinking, you grab your neck. Your eyes grow wider. 

There are vampire bats, tarantulas, and a howling werewolf with mucus- 
slimed fur. Next to the werewolf, cages of scraggly-haired, wart-covered old 
women reach for you through slime-covered bars. 

Scaly-skinned dragons breathe fire at your face when you look in their 
direction. Hissing vipers hang down from the ceiling and brush against your 
ears. One wriggling snake drops onto your shoulder. 


Quick, turn to PAGE 10 . 




107 

The clock. You’ve got to use the clock. But how? No use trying to reverse 
time while you’re under the spell of the Keeper of All Times. Then you notice 
something strange. Your eyes are getting watery but you can still see it. The 
old woman is aging, too! She’s hideously old. Older than you. 

You get an idea. Maybe — if you push the clock hands forward — maybe 
she’ll die off first! It’s risky. But right now it seems to be your only shot. 

Your shaking old hand moves slowly against the hands of the clock. They 
move forward minute by minute by minute. You are all aging, but the old 
woman is aging faster. One more minute to go and she will fall to 
nothingness. 

“No!” the woman cries. “No! I’m cracking ...” 

10...9...8...7...6...5 seconds left. You, Abbey, and Kip lean on one 
another’s tired old bones and watch the wafer-thin-skinned woman withering 
away. You don’t have the strength to look away. 4...3...2...1 second to 
go. GONE! It’s over! The woman is nothing more than a paper-thin piece of 
parchment on the floor! You have destroyed one more evil force. For the old 
woman it’s 

THE END. 


But for you, there ’s more to come on PAGE 6 . 





108 

You know you should run. But for some reason your legs won’t move. 
“We’re stuck!” you yell. “Stuck!” You try to move your feet, but they are 
rooted to the ground. In fact, they are in the ground! 

Kip and Abbey can’t move either. Their feet are just as rooted as yours. 
And both of their bodies have started to turn green. They’re getting thinner, 
too. Very, very thin. So are you! Old Mr. Triple-decker is casting his favorite 
spell. He’s mumbling some gibberish over there in the corner. 

You have become the latest addition to his garden. You look out from 
your petal-framed face and see the petunias and snapdragons you passed on 
your way in. Funny. Now you notice they have faces. 

“He got you, too, I see,” a purple petunia rooted next to you says. “No 
one knows the evil he sows!” 

“Curses, soiled again!” a zinnia teases. 

“He got all of us,” Abbey sighs from beneath her rose-petaled bonnet. 
“But at least I’m a rose!” 

Looks like you’re grounded this time. But life in a wizard’s garden can’t 
be all bad. Who knows? It might even grow on you. 


THE END 



109 

You turn the hands on the hot-pink clock forward — a little bit too far, by 
accident. Immediately you feel your joints stiffening. “Hmm, that’s strange,” 
you say. And then you hack a big cough. 

“What’s that you say, Sonny?” a squeaky voice says. It’s Kip! But he 
looks grotesque! He’s hunched over and leans closer as he cups his right ear 
with one hand. “Speak up there, youngster!” he squeaks. He’s getting older 
and older before your very eyes. 

“Who are you calling a youngster there, Grandpa?” Abbey cackles. Her 
face is a mess of wrinkles. You see them forming on her face like worms, 
doubling and tripling themselves. She looks older than your grandmother. 
Whoops! Make that your great-grandmother! 

“Stop the clock before it’s too late!” Kip screeches in an ancient-sounding 
voice. Your hands are wrinkled and gnarled now. Your fingers can hardly 
move over the clock face. You sneeze and when you do, an old woman 
appears before you. It’s like she came out of your nose! 

“Who summons me with a sneeze?” demands the raggedy old woman. 
“Was it you, old man?” she asks, whirling around and pointing a crooked, 
bony finger at you. 


Turn to PAGE 18. 




110 

You pull down on the rotten rope. It breaks off in your hands! 

“No bell tolls for us! No bell tolls for us! No bell tolls for us!” The 
ghostly, hooded robed monks chant solemnly. They’ve made it to the bell 
tower where you are! 

Abbey and Kip reach their hands out to you. “Join us,” they drone. “Be 
one with us. No bell tolls for us. No bell tolls for us.” 

“Abbey! Kip!” you plead with them. “Don’t fade! Don’t fade!” 

It’s no use. Your cousins’ faces are getting fainter and fainter. The 
chanting of the monks echoes in your ears. “No bell tolls for us. No bell tolls 
for us. No bell tolls for us.” 

You know you have to escape from here before it’s too late. 

Race to PAGE 88. 




111  

The Knight in Screaming Armor lies silent at your feet! You can’t believe 
it. It’s almost too good to be true. But it is! 

You turn to the Sorceress and lift your battle-ax in a salute to her. 

Then, THWACK! to your armored back. A powerful blow crushes you to 
your knees. It sends vibrations ringing through your armor and every one of 
your bones. 

The Evil Knight is not finished with you yet. 

The armor you wear is very heavy. But you manage to lift yourself back 
to your feet. You raise your battle-ax again and wait for the chance to move 
in. 

“WELCOME TO YOUR KNIGHT-MARE!” the Evil Knight bellows at 
you. 

But you’ve heard that before. If he thinks he’s going to scare you away, 
he’s got another thing coming. And, in fact, he does have another thing 
coming: the sharpened blade of your battle-ax! 

It’s now or never. While he’s still laughing his wicked laugh, you set your 
feet, swing around in a full circle, and release the battle-ax like a Frisbee. 
Almost in slow motion, it travels toward his face. It smashes into him in a 
burst of smoke. 


See through the vapors on PAGE 136 . 




112 

When you glance around you are shocked to see that you are back in your 
own garage! Everything is familiar. Two giant crates stand in front of you. 
One is labeled: evil knight. The other one says: good knight. 

The garage isn’t the only thing that’s familiar. Everything you’re saying 
and hearing is familiar, too! At least for a moment. Then it all starts to seem 
normal again.... 

“Which one should we open?” you say nervously. 

“Neither!” Kip replies. He seems terrified. 

Maybe a little too terrified. You’re not sure you buy all this curse stuff. 
Maybe it’s all a big trick. Kip and Abbey could have gotten someone to shout 
and shake the crate around. Who’s really in that Evil Knight crate, anyway? 
you wonder. 

Then again. Those screams do sound pretty spooky! 

Maybe you should play it safe and open the crate marked good knight. A 
suit of armor could come in handy if there is some crazy curse. 


If you open the crate marked good knight, turn to PAGE 33 . 
If you open the crate marked evil knight, turn to PAGE 49 . 





113 

The garage door swings up and out of your way. 

Dark was never as dark as this. Monsters seem to lurk in every corner. 
Familiar forms look strange. The beam of your flashlight cuts past the 
frightful shadowy figures to the two crates. They stand like tombstones in the 
middle of the garage. Except that one of them is vibrating. Shaking back and 
forth. 

The light reflects off a label on one of the crates. The one with the curse 
on it. Then you notice another handwritten label near the top of each crate. 
One says: evil knight. The other reads: good knight. 

“Which one should we open?” you say nervously. 

“Neither!” Kip replies. He seems terrified. 

Maybe a little too terrified. You’re not sure you buy all this curse stuff. 
Maybe it’s all a big trick. Kip and Abbey could have gotten someone to shout 
and shake the crate around. Who’s really in that “Evil Knight” crate, anyway? 
you wonder. 

Then again. Those screams do sound pretty spooky! 

Maybe you should play it safe and open the crate marked good knight. A 
suit of armor could come in handy if there is some crazy curse.

114 

You look at Abbey and are amazed to see her boldly batting at some 
hanging snakes. She’s pretty brave, you think. 

“Get away from my hair!” she yells as she knocks another snake to the 
ground. Then she misses one. It drops onto her shoulder and starts to wrap 
itself around her head! 

“Aaahh!” Abbey cries. “Help me!” She falls to the floor, pulling at the 
snake. “Help!” she screams again. “Save me!” 

Kip tries to be brave. He runs to help his sister. In his rush, he trips into an 
open-mouthed steel trap. His left leg is grabbed by the jagged metal teeth of 
the trap. “Help!” Kip cries. He can’t get free to help Abbey. He can’t even 
help himself. 

It’s all up to you now. Only you have a chance of earning the right to wear 
the armor of the Good Knight. 


Turn to PAGE 126. 




115 

The huge, black bird takes a sudden turn to the left. “Help!” you yell. You 
tumble off the bird’s back. 

“Help!” Kip cries as he, too, is thrown from the feathered back of the 
bird. 

Luckily, the bird is flying low to the ground. Unluckily, the ground isn’t 
ground at all. It’s water! 

SPLASH! You plunge into freezing cold water. 

The bird screeches as it flies away. 

“Sink or swim! Sink or swim! Sink or swim!” chant the voices of three 
withered old women standing on a nearby shore. And then a crashing wave 
sends you down into the deep.

It’s no use trying to find your way out of the mess of hedges surrounding 
you. 

“We’ll have to break through,” you decide. “It’s our only choice.” 

“Okay, but I better not get a scratch!” Abbey warns. “I’ve worked too 
hard for this beautiful complexion.” 

The three of you turn your backs to the high, thick hedge. “On the count 
of three we ram it!” you say. You link arms. “One, two, three!” you count. All 
together you throw yourselves backward against the towering green wall. You 
fall through, landing flat on your backs on the other side. 

“Hooray!” Kip cheers. “We did it!” 

Before you and Abbey can add your own cheers, thousands of little 
animals tumble out of the hedge and cover you! Their fur is thick and coarse 
like spines. 

“Oooooooooh! I hate dirty critters!” Abbey exclaims. “Get out of my 
hair!” 

“Hedgehogs!” you cry. “They’re holding us down.” 


Quick, turn to PAGE 94 . 




117 

You’re alone and still falling. It began as a fast fall. But now it’s more like 
you’re floating gently. You look up and barely see the black nighthawk. Kip 
managed to stay on the bird. Will you ever see Kip and Abbey again? 

Below, you see emerald-green grass. It’s getting closer and closer. You 
can tell your landing isn’t going to be deadly, though. The grass will make a 
soft cushion for your fall. 

You float down, settling at last on a moss-covered knoll — right in front 
of a familiar cottage! 

The front door opens. A voice whispers, “Come in. You are so good to 
visit me.” 

You have no choice, turn to PAGE 77 . 




118 

“Show your face, Evil Knight!” You nervously challenge the master of 
this evil museum again. 

“Choose your weapon. Choose your weapon,” chants the scraggliest of all 
the caged old women. She points a bony finger to a platform where a battle- 
ax, a gleaming sword, a jousting lance, and a dagger are on display. 

“Hmmm,” you say. “I wonder why I didn’t see that there before?” You 
step closer to the platform to get a better look. 

As you reach across to take hold of the battle-ax, all the weapons vanish! 
Shining like a hundred mirrors, a gleaming silver suit of armor appears in 
their place. 

Could it be? you think. Could it be the armor of the Good Knight at last? 

As you step forward to touch the armor, it disappears into thin air. 

Then, WHAM! An iron cage crashes down around you! 

Sorry — it’s not the armor of the Good Knight at last. But it is your last 
good night. 


THE END 



119 

Kip and Abbey follow you through the hole in the back of the crate. 

When all three of you are through, something slams shut behind you. You 
turn to look, and the crate has disappeared! All you see around you are hills. 
Soft, green, rolling hills. 

“It’s so beautiful,” you say. “It’s a whole new world.” You rub your eyes, 
but it doesn’t go away. 

“It’s OUR world!” Abbey exclaims. “We’re back in England!” 

“It’s exactly where the Evil Knight wants us to be,” Kip says softly. 
“England. The land of the Saxtons. England.” 

“Who cares?” Abbey says. “We’re home!” 

“Don’t look so happy,” Kip warns. “The Evil Knight wants to destroy us. 
We may be home for good! Or should I say, for evil?” 

You gaze around you stunned. There’s no way to explain what just 
happened to you. Hundreds of sheep are grazing on a nearby hill. One wild¬ 
looking ram glances up at you. Your heart jumps. 

“His eyes are glowing!” you cry out. 

Your pulse starts to race. The horned head of the ram morphs into the 
armored head of the Evil Knight! He lowers his head and paws the ground. 
Steam pours through the grill on his helmet. 

“He’s going to ram us!” you cry. “Run for your lives!” 


Run to PAGE 97. 




120 

“You really had us going there,” Kip says as he and Abbey follow you 
into the house. 

“I told you not to tell those stupid stories about the Knight in Screaming 
Armor,” Abbey scolds her brother. “You gave our cousin nightmares!” 

After a good group laugh, the three of you head back to bed. When you 
hang your robe over your desk chair you notice little prickly leaves stuck to it. 

“Huh?” you say. Where did those leaves come from? you wonder. There 
aren’t any prickly bushes like that around here. Maybe it wasn’t a dream at 
all! 

You climb in bed and pull your covers up to your chin. Your eyes are 
getting tired. You listen for a few seconds to hear if any noises are coming 
from the garage. Nothing. 

Not this time. But before? Hmmmmm, you think as your eyes finally 
close. Maybe. Oh well. “Good night,” you say to no one in particular. 

“Evil Knight,” replies a deep voice next to you on your pillow. You feel a 
gust of hot air on your face. 


THE END 



121 

When the rumbling of the avalanche is done, you brush the dust off your 
face and glance around. 

In the light of the full moon you see a trench in the middle of the hill. “It 
worked!” you shout. “The avalanche has cleared a path!” 

“And look what I found,” Kip says. He holds up a shiny metal key. “It 
was right here under this rock.” 

“Kip, you’re a genius!” you say again happily. 

Turn to PAGE 134. 




122 

You sink into the deep, cold water. Deeper and deeper. Your lungs are 
about to burst from holding your breath so long. At last you sink to the 
bottom of this lake and land at the mouth of an underwater cave. 

You motion to Kip and swim for the opening. He’s right behind you. 

You swim into the cave, through a tunnel, and up a channel to air! 

“Pfwah!” you exhale. “Huuup!” you gulp in the fresh air. Kip does the 
same until both of you are breathing normally again. 

“Come in,” a familiar voice welcomes you. “We’ve been waiting for 
you.” 

You can’t quite place it. Where do you know that voice from? 
Hmmmmmmm. “We’ve been waiting for you....” 

Turn to PAGE 56. 




123 

You see stone steps in the corner of the basement. 

“We’d better see what’s up there,” you whisper. You lead the way up the 
stone steps. Medieval paintings line the walls. Carved angels hover near the 
arched ceiling. “It’s like a castle,” you say. 

“It’s a monastery!” Abbey corrects you. “Monks probably used to live 
here centuries ago.” 

“Then who’s that chanting in the next room?” Kip gulps. The chanting 
grows louder and louder as you enter a large dining room. Long benches are 
filled with robed figures bent over a narrow wooden table. The figures keep 
their hooded heads bowed. They chant over their meal. 

“There’s no food on the table!” Kip whispers loudly. 

All the figures turn around at once. 

“Oh!” Abbey lets out a startled cry. 

The robes are empty! Where their faces should be, there’s empty space! 
They’re ghosts! 

You make a break for the stairs. But you’re all alone when you get there. 


Find out why on PAGE 135 . 




124 

You may be climbing on pieces of people, but as rocks, they’re not going 
to hurt you — or you, them, for that matter. 

Kip and Abbey are probably fine. Maybe they just can’t hear you. 

If they are turning to stone, they’re not going anywhere, are they? And 
you’re not sure what you could do to help them, anyway. 

You decide to keep climbing the last little bit up the slope. You’ll grab 
that shining object — whatever it is — while you’ve got the chance. You’re 
almost there. 

The rock you’re standing on is totally unstable. You have to do a real 
balancing act to keep from crashing down on the rocks below. Slowly, 
carefully, you reach for the silver object. It’s long and shiny. 

When you’ve got a hold of it, you try to lift it up. But it lifts you up! Up 
into the air. The shiny thing is a metal finger that’s attached to a metal hand 
that’s attached to ... THE KNIGHT IN SCREAMING ARMOR! 


Meet your doom on PAGE 66 . 




125 

The speeding black nighthawk doesn’t hear you. It just keeps flying. The 
mountainside approaches. CRASH! 

Purple stars flutter before your eyes. Your toes feel numb. Darkness 
surrounds you. You feel your own arm just to see if you’re alive. “I am alive!” 
you shout happily. 

“You call this living?” Abbey’s voice says. 

“Abbey!” you and Kip both say. “It’s you! What happened?” 

“We crashed and now we’re crushed! That’s what happened.” 

Abbey’s right. The crash seemed to break the spell. Now you’re crushed 
together inside the Evil Knight’s crate! Back in your garage! In America! 
Home! 

“It started when we entered the crate,” Kip says groggily. “A secret door, 
another world and time ... and ...” 

“... and the worst night of my life! Aawwk!” Abbey squawks. She pushes 
on the door of the crate. You bang on it. Kip throws his weight against it. It 
won’t open. 

“AAAaaaaaahh! Aaaaah!” It’s your scream coming from inside the crate. 
But you can scream all you want, no one’s going to let you out. They’ve heard 
it all before. Those screams inside that crate. It’s just the Curse of the Knight 
in Screaming Armor. A curse that never comes to an 


END. 



126 

Over your cousins’ cries for help, the scraggly old women in cages cackle, 
“Fight the evil! Earn the armor!” 

Bats baring vampire fangs fly down at you from above. You flail your 
arms at them. The fire of the dragons’ breath reaches for you with its flaming 
fingers. You shield your eyes. You take a deep breath and move toward the 
steel trap holding Kip’s leg. 

Before your hand gets close enough to try to free him, a gust of smoke 
fills the room. Huge puffs of black smoke burn your eyes. “I can’t see a 
thing!” you shout. 

You put your hands out in front of you and feel something smooth and 
metallic. A suit of armor! 

You rub the smoke from your eyes and squint. “Yes!” you shout. “It’s the 
armor of the Good Knight!” 

You try to open the armor to put it on. It’s no use. No amount of tugging 
will get you into the suit. You haven’t earned the right to wear it yet. 

“Grab the battle-ax!” Kip cries. 

The armor holds a gleaming battle-ax in its glove. 

“Please save us,” Abbey pleads as she pulls at her snakeskin necklace. 

You yank the battle-ax from the steel-gloved hand of the suit of armor. It 
pulls free! 


Go to PAGE 129. 




127 

Kip and Abbey burst through the door. 

“What’s happening in here?” Abbey shouts. 

“We heard terrible screams!” Kip adds. “Are you okay?” 

You sit up. That’s right. You sit up and push the covers aside. You’re in 
BED! Back at HOME! At last! 

“It was the Knight in Screaming Armor. We had an awesome battle and I 
killed him!” you exclaim proudly. “I broke the curse and brought us home!” 

“What are you talking about?” Kip asks. “The Knight in Screaming what ? 
Oh, you mean that crazy story my grandfather used to tell? How did you 
know about that?” 

“Kip! Abbey!” you shout. “You have to remember! The Evil Knight was 
going to destroy all that was good ‘unless a brave and noble Saxton could 
defeat it.’ Remember? We traveled to England and fought the Evil Knight!” 

“You? Traveled to England?” Abbey says as she flicks her hair. “In your 
dreams!” 

But it wasn’t in your dreams. And the proof is on your bedroom floor at 
Abbey’s feet: a small crumpled up scrap of metal. You almost didn’t notice it. 
Except that it’s steaming. 

Now you know that this story has come to a happy 


END 



128 

“COME FORWARD!” the Evil Knight repeats from the darkness behind 
the door. His voice works some evil magic on you. You see black and white 
spirals spinning before your eyes. You struggle to look away, but you can’t. 
“COME FORWARD! COME FORWARD!” he booms. You are hypnotized 
by his command. 

“No!” Abbey cries. “Cover your ears! Don’t listen to him! Don’t go in 
there! I command you!” 

But still your feet shuffle forward. 

You get a funny feeling as you pass through the doorway. Somehow, you 
know this room isn’t on the official map of the Medieval Museum. 

But still, you’ve just got to see what’s in there! 

“Stop!” Kip yells as you enter the dark room. “It could be a torture 
chamber, or filled with hungry beasts! Come back!” 

Poor Kip, he could never understand ... 


Follow your feet into the darkness on PAGE 90 .

All the creatures in the cages are pressed against the bars, heckling. The 
purple one spits snails at you. They crunch under your feet as you walk. The 
werewolf snarls through his drool. It takes all of your strength to lift the 
enormous battle-ax. 

Then you swing it. 

It crashes down on the werewolf’s cage like a ton of bricks. There’s an 
explosion. A burst of smoke. And when it all clears, the beast is gone! 

You swing the ax again. This time at the dragons. They explode, too! One 
by one they vanish — the bats, the vipers, the wretched hecklers, even the 
steel trap holding Kip’s leg. They all go up in puffs of smoke. 

“You’ve done it!” Abbey shouts happily. “You saved us!” 

“Good work, cousin!” Kip adds, patting you on the back. Each pat sends a 
metal ringing through your ears. You’re staring out at your cousins through a 
metal face mask! 

“Hey!” you cry out. “Hey! Hey! Hey!” your voice echoes back. Suddenly, 
you realize you’re not the same kid you were a minute ago. You have 
confronted all your fears and won! Your bravery has earned you the right to 
wear the armor of the Good Knight! 


But it’s not THE END, the Evil Knight is waiting for you on PAGE 80 . 




130 

It’s a Dorm of Doom, and you’re the only student. A ghastly light shines 
from somewhere above you. The yellow glow reveals a throne. On the throne 
is a woman. She smiles. “Are you the mighty Saxton who will fight for 
right?” she asks. 

“Me? I-I-I’m j-j-j-just a k-k-kid,” you stammer. 

“PUT ON THE ARMOR!” the woman bellows. 

You feel something hard against your back. You turn and come face-to- 
face with a shining suit of silver armor. You gasp. One steely-gloved hand 
holds a battle-ax. The other hand holds a shield engraved with the Saxton 
family crest. 

Magically, the armor pops open. You don’t know what else to do, so you 
step in. It closes in around you. 

You feel taller and stronger than you’ve ever felt before. The battle-ax 
feels like a feather in your armored, gloved hand. You look out from the silver 
face mask. The woman on the throne starts to laugh. 

“Yes, yes,” she cackles. “That is the way Sir Edmund looked when he got 
what he deserved. And I’m the one who GAVE IT TO HIM! I’m the 
SORCERESS!”

The hanging lightbulb starts to spin. Kip struggles to lift his sister to her 
feet. He looks really scared now. It’s going to be up to you to do something. 
But what? Should you open the Evil Knight’s crate and confront the enemy — 
whatever it is? Maybe it’s all just a practical joke. You wouldn’t put it past 
Kip, would you? 

Then again, maybe there really is a curse. If there is, maybe whatever’s in 
the crate marked good knight could help you. You’d better open one of them. 
Which will it be?

“Ouch!” Abbey cries. She breaks herself free from the prickly bush. You 
can’t help laughing. Abbey’s a human pincushion! She has little prickly 
leaves stuck all over her. 

“OUCH!” you and Kip say together as you fall out of the bushes. You 
find yourselves looking like two porcupines, too. 

You hear giggles. And they’re not Abbey’s. You glance over your 
shoulder and see something you never imagined you’d see. 

Two miniature men are laughing and rolling on the ground. Each man is 
about the size of a football. They laugh and smack their knees and point at 
you. 

“Pixies!” Kip cries. 

“Pixies?” you say. “You’ve got to be kidding me!” 

The little men disappear for a minute. They resurface in the bushes close 

by. 

“This way out!” one giggles, pointing to the left. 

“No, this way out!” says the other, pointing to the right. Which one can 
you trust?

You peer closer at the hand sticking up out of the rocks. It’s only made of 
stone! That’s when you notice that the rock you’re sitting on has a face! 

“Aaaah!” you yell. The stone face is frozen in an expression of pain. You 
move to another rock. But as you look around, ALL of the broken rocks are 
shaped like PEOPLE! BROKEN PIECES OF PEOPLE! 

“Abbey! Kip!” you cry. But there’s no answer. 

You can’t see them from where you are without losing your balance. What 
if they’re turning into stone or something! you think. You call out again. But 
again, there’s no reply. 

What’s going on? Maybe they just can’t hear you from down below. But 
maybe you should climb back down and check on them. Just to be safe. 

If you keep climbing for the shimmering object, turn to PAGE 124 . 

If you scramble back down the mountain to help your cousins, turn to

The three of you make your way up the path. All the way up and over the 
top of the hill. Off in the distance, you see a cottage. 

“It’s that cottage again,” you say. Then you have an idea. “The key! 

Maybe it fits the door to that cottage!” 

After walking on all those rocking rocks, the trip to the cottage is easy. No 
pixies change your path. No sheep stampede. And so far there’s no Evil 
Knight in sight. 

“Hurry!” you call to Kip and Abbey. You move quickly and quietly along 
the dirt road to the cottage. 

When you are a few feet from it, you stop to look at the cottage more 
carefully. It’s a small, two-story, white house with a thatched roof. A garden 
of petunias and snapdragons lines the curved stone walkway leading to the 
heavy wooden door. 

“I wonder who lives here?” Abbey asks. “It’s quite stylish in an old- 
fashioned way.” 

She peeks in the windows. “It’s too dark in there,” she whispers. “I can’t 
see a thing!” 

You knock on the door. There’s no answer. You knock harder. Still no 
answer. 

“Try the key,” Kip suggests. 

You put the silver key in the lock and try to twist your hand. 


Turn to PAGE 39. 




135 

When you get to the stone steps, you look back for Abbey and Kip. But 
they’re not there. 

Then you see them. They’re walking over toward the table. What are they 
doing? “Come on, you guys! This way!” you shout. But it’s too late. Their 
faces are already starting to fade! 

The chanting grows louder. Now you can hear what they’re saying. “No 
bell tolls for us. No bell tolls for us, ” they chant. 

Find out what it means on PAGE 41. 




136 

“AAAaaaahhhh!” the Evil Knight screams again. But this time his 
screams fade slowly away. Through the smoke you see the heap of black 
armor shrivel up and turn into ... into ... a ball of tinfoil on the floor. 

From the throne in the corner, the Sorceress cries out, “No! No! All spells 
are broken! All spells are broken!” 

You watch in amazement as her throne disappears. Her Sorceress robes 
turn to rags. Her face grows older and older even as you watch. The evil 
creatures around you shrivel and vanish. 

The Sorceress is nothing more now than a bent and withered old woman. 
The iron gate is gone. The darkness in the dungeon starts to lift. 

Then, you hear pounding on the door behind you. 

POUND! POUND! POUND! What could it possibly be now?

GIVE YOURSELF GOOSEBUMPS! 



“Nerd Alert! Nerd Alert!” 



We interrupt your perfect summer vacation at Deep Woods Lake to bring 
you this special Nerd News: Your parents have invited their best friends, Mr. 
and Mrs. Morris, and their supernerd son, Todd, to share the cabin with your 
family this year! You can’t believe it. Your worst nerdmare has just come 
true. 

“This can’t be happening to me!” you say aloud as your family’s minivan 
pulls up to WoodsWorld. You’ve already spotted the Morrises’ car. It’s parked 
beneath a string of colored lanterns hanging over the entrance to 
WoodsWorld. WoodsWorld is the cabin community that your family has 
vacationed at every summer since you were a baby. 

Then you spot Todd. He’s gawky, stringy-haired, and wears thick black- 
rimmed glasses. 

“Hey! Hey! What do you say?” Todd calls to you. His big hand whirly- 
birds out of the car window in a nerdy wave. 

“Be nice,” your mom cautions. 

“Yes, maybe Todd is different now,” says your dad. 

“Oh, he’s different, all right,” you moan. “From everyone else on this 
whole planet!”

Your minivan and the Morrises’ car both roll up the gravel drive next to 
Evergreen Cabin. You gaze around. Nothing has changed since last summer. 
The woods behind your cabin are still dark and deep. The sparkling blue lake 
in front of the cabin is as smooth as glass. A narrow, sandy beach stretches 
into an easy curve around the shoreline of the lake. 

The sun has almost set, leaving behind a fiery pink-orange glow in the 
sky. There’s enough daylight left for you to notice a note taped to the screen 
door of your cabin. 

“Cool!” you cry. You jump out of the car. “That must be a note from my 
friends,” you tell your parents. You sprint across the lawn and up the porch 
steps. You pull the note off the cabin door. 

To read what the note says, turn to PAGE 3 .

You unfold the note. You read it out loud. “Kids-only campfire tonight — 
eight p.m. at the beach.” 

“Wonderful!” your mom cries, as she hurries up behind you. “It’s only 
seven o’clock now. You can help unload the car and then go. This will be a 
perfect opportunity for the other WoodsWorld kids to meet Todd.” 

“And a perfect opportunity for them to think I’m a nerd, too, because I’m 
with him,” you mutter. But no one hears you. Your parents and Mr. and Mrs. 
Morris have gone inside the cabin. 

You watch Todd unload his stuff from the car. As he pulls out a red tin 
box, three very large, red-haired boys bike up your driveway. They’re the 
Murphy brothers — Jess, Buck, and Sharky. 

“Welcome to WoodsWorld, Nerdo,” the oldest brother, Sharky, taunts 
Todd. Sharky is fifteen. He looks as if he has been lifting weights since he 
was two years old. Last summer a kid told you that Sharky got his nickname 
because “getting into a fight with Sharky is like trying to survive a shark 
attack.” 

“I see you brought us a present,” Sharky says to Todd. He grabs the tin 
box and tosses it to his youngest brother, Jess. 

“Hey!” Todd shouts. “That’s my pewter figure collection! Bring that box 
back!” Tears form in his eyes as the Murphy brothers pedal away, taking the 
box with them.
