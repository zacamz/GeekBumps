`BEWARE!! 

DO NOT READ THIS 
BOOK FROM 
BEGINNING TO END! 

Yes! Mom and Dad are out of town, and your sweet old grandma is coming 
to take care of you. You are ready for freedom. But are you ready for ... 

Grandma ? 

The terror starts at the train station, with two old ladies who both look 
exactly like your grandma. 

If you go after the Grandma who is still on the train, you might end up 
battling aliens with eyes the size of Ping-Pong balls. Or jumping from a hovering 
helicopter! If you go home with the other Grandma, we have one piece of advice 
for you: 

Stay out of the rose garden! 

This scary adventure is all about you. You decide what will happen. And you 
decide how terrifying the scares will be! 

Start on PAGE 1. Then follow the instructions at the bottom of each page. 

You make the choices. If you choose well, you’ll survive this adventure. But if 
you make the wrong choice ... BEWARE! 


SO TAKE A DEEP BREATH. CROSS YOUR FINGERS. AND TURN TO 
PAGE 1 TO GIVE YOURSELF GOOSEBUMPS!

“Nothing is going to happen to me,” you shout down to your mother. 

She gazes up at you from the bottom of the stairs. Her packed suitcases sit 
waiting by the front door. You recognize that worried look on her face. 

“Do you remember everything I told you?” she asks. Her forehead wrinkles 
in concern. “Or should I write it down?” 

“Mom! I’m not a baby.” You plop onto the top step of the staircase and 
repeat your instructions for the fifth time. “I take a cab to the railroad station. I 
wait on the platform on the incoming side of the station. Grandma’s train arrives 
at one p.m. I’ll know her by the yellow stretch pants and purple shirt she’ll be 
wearing. Then, if she hasn’t been arrested by the fashion police for wearing such 
a wacko outfit —” 

“Don’t make fun of your grandmother,” your mother cuts in. “She’s unusual, 
but I’m sure you two will get along fine.” 

“Your mother’s right,” your dad adds, coming through the front door. “Your 
grandma is full of surprises.” 

Yeah sure, you think. How is some little old lady going to surprise me? 


Go on to PAGE 2.

Your dad picks up the remaining suitcases and heads back out to the car. 
Your mother doesn’t move. You flash her your most trustworthy smile. 

She sighs. “I guess you’ll be all right,” she says uncertainly. 

“Of course I will!” you assure her. “What could happen?” 

You follow your mom out to the car and wave as your parents drive away. 
The moment their car turns the corner you leap into the air. “Freedom!” you cry. 

No parents for a whole week! Just a seventy-five-year-old grandma. She’ll 
probably spend the whole time snoozing on the sun porch. You’ll practically be 
on your own! 

The cab arrives, and you hop in. You instruct the driver to take you to the 
train station. 

But as he nears the station you have a pang of doubt. You haven’t seen your 
grandmother since you were a little kid. You wonder if you’ll recognize her. 


Worry until PAGE 3 .

You may not recognize Grandma’s face, you tell yourself, but you’ll 
definitely spot her purple-and-yellow outfit. Besides, she’ll know you from the 
photos your parents sent her. 

You pay the driver and hop out. 

Hey! That’s weird, you think. Why was your name announced over the 
loudspeaker? You rush to the information booth inside the station, wondering 
what could be wrong. 

“You just paged me,” you tell the young man in the booth. 

“You’ve got a call.” He hands you a phone. 

“Hello?” There’s a lot of static on the line. You can barely hear, but it’s 
definitely your mom’s voice. 

“We’re — psst — on the plane ... pfffft — home immediately!” 

“What? I can’t hear you!” you shout into the phone. “Do you want me to go 
home? What about Grandma?” 

“Pssssfffft — danger ... grandmother ...” 

That’s all you hear. Then the line goes dead.

You’re surprised to see your friends Chuck and Ginny rushing toward you. 

“Hey, guys,” you greet them. “I’m here to meet my grandmother. How about 
you?” 

“We’re going to the hockey game, remember?” Chuck tells you. “I invited 
you.” 

You remember. You couldn’t go because of Grandma’s arrival. 

“Our moms are letting us take the train on our own!” Ginny adds. “Of 
course, we had to promise to stay out of trouble.” Ginny giggles. “As if!” 

“Have fun with Grandma,” Chuck teases. They board the train. 

You sigh jealously as you scan the thinning crowd. 

Still no grandmother. 

Is this what your mother had been trying to tell you? That your grandmother 
wasn’t coming after all? 

You’re about to leave the station when you hear something that stops you in 
your tracks. Something terrible.

Wait and see seems like the best thing to do. 

But you don’t want to do it here! 

You double-check the newspaper article. “Let’s get back here when the 
meteor shower is supposed to begin,” you instruct Sophie and Andrew. “Then 
maybe we’ll find out how it all ties in together.” 

You leave a note for Grandma and head over to the park to play Frisbee. You 
can’t help wondering what will happen. You’re so distracted you miss the 
Frisbee every single time. 

At seven p.m. sharp, you, Sophie, and Andrew creep back to the rose garden. 
It looks spooky in the dark. The roses seem even larger than they did before. 

There’s no sign of Grandma. 


Turn to PAGE 15.

CRRRRCKKK! you hear again. 

You peer up into the tree by your front gate. “There’s a man up there!” you 
exclaim. 

“Don’t look up!” the man in the tree orders. 

You, Sophie, and Andrew immediately stare down at the ground. 

“Tell me,” the man continues, “is your grandma around?” 

Your head snaps up. “Do you want to see her?” you demand. 

“No! No!” the man tells you in a hoarse whisper. “I want to make sure she 
doesn’t see me!” 

“She’s in the back,” you tell him. 

The man leaps down out of the tree. His brown eyes narrow as he studies 
your face. He seems to be sizing you up. 

Two can play at that game, you figure. You check him out. His black hair is 
cut very short. He wears torn black jeans and a black T-shirt. 

“So who are you?” Sophie blurts. 

“Special Agent Bendrey,” the man says. “I’m an alien investigator. And I 
think the four of us should have a chat.” 

Should you trust this guy? Maybe he can help you. 

Or maybe he’s another impostor!

“Forget it,” you scold the cab driver. “That’s snooping.” 

The front door pops open. 

“What’s taking you so long?” Grandma demands. She strides to the cab, 
grasps the suitcase handles, and lifts both bags. 

“I need to start working out,” the cab driver mutters. 

“Come on, Cookie!” Grandma beams at you. “Show me my room.” 

“It’s at the top of the stairs,” you tell her. 

You follow her into the house. 

“Perfect,” she croons, entering the guest room. “Right over the rose garden. 
I’ll watch my babies growing out of the ground.” 

Did you hear right? “Your babies?” you repeat. 

Grandma spins around and stares at you. Then she smiles. “I think of the 
rose bushes as my babies,” she explains. 

Grandma isn’t just unusual, you think. She’s plain weird! 

You peer down. You’ve never paid much attention to the garden before. It 
takes up most of the backyard. Dozens of flowers sprout from each bush. Okay, 
so this year they’re wacky colors. And they are much larger than usual. 

But basically, what’s the big deal? 

Grandma suddenly stiffens beside you!

The three new Grandmas chatter at once. “So there you are!” 

“Hope number three didn’t cause trouble!” 

“Is everyone all right in here?” 

“What’s going on?” you scream. 

Silence fills the train car. 

All of the Grandmas stare at you. So do Chuck and Ginny. 

“Excuse me for yelling,” you say. “But would someone please explain to me 
what’s happening here?” 

Grandma #1 laughs. “I was just getting to that!” she tells you. “Allow me to 
introduce my clones.” 

Then she explains the whole unbelievable story. 

Your grandma is a top government scientist working on a secret cloning 
project. A project everyone seems to want to get their hands on! That’s why she’s 
coming to stay with you — to hide out. 

You’re the luckiest kid in the world. For the next month you have five 
Grandmas. And they all spoil you! 


THE END

You gaze down at the garden, holding your breath. 

“Nothing’s moving,” Sophie says. 

“No sounds,” Andrew adds hopefully. 

You nod. Could you have done it? Did you actually destroy the aliens? 

You open your mouth to say something. But then your jaw drops. 

Dozens of wormy aliens slither out from under the mattress. And they’re 
bigger than they were five minutes ago! 

“It didn’t work!” you wail. 

“Maybe the mattress was too soft,” Andrew says. 

“It wasn’t heavy enough,” you realize. “Throw everything you can get your 
hands on!” 

Frantically, you grab a chair and footstool. Out the window! Andrew and 
Sophie toss down Grandma’s suitcases. You hurl out the stereo and a radio. They 
land with a crash. The radio blasts on. 

There’s nothing left to throw. And the aliens are still swarming around in the 
garden! 


Turn to PAGE 130.

You don’t have a moment to lose. The train car below you is filled with 
those creatures! And they’ve found you! They’ll be climbing up after you any 
minute now! 

“Geronimo!” you shout to Chuck and Ginny. 

Then you leap off the train! 

Oops! Bad timing. The train is going over a bridge. Avery high bridge. 
It’s a loooooooong way down. 

So long, in fact, that you have time to read the big banner hanging on the 
side of the train car: 

EVANSTOWN HIGH SCHOOL ANNUAL COSTUME PARTY. 

Too bad you didn’t notice it sooner. 

Say good-bye, party animal! 


THE END 



11 


“Out! Now!” Grandma rasps. 

She heard you. 

You and your friends crawl out from under the bed. 

You gaze at the horrifying creature in front of you. Grandma’s human face is 
shoved up on top of her head, as if it were a Halloween mask. In its place is an 
oozing blob of flesh. A single yellow eye gleams in the center. 

“Interfering fools!” the Grandma-creature booms. “Now I will have to 
destroy you ahead of schedule!” 

Before you can protest, the creature spits at you. 

Gross! A long, sticky strand of saliva flies out of her mouth. It attaches to 
your forehead and wraps around Sophie’s and Andrew’s heads. It burns where it 
touches your skin. 

“Yuck!” Sophie shrieks. 

The creature spits over and over again. The strands are like a spider’s web. 
Soon, you and your friends are completely encased in a sticky cocoon. You can’t 
see a thing. 

“You can’t escape the pod,” the creature informs you. “And the acid in the 
web will eat through your flesh.” 

You hear her leave the room. 

This is one sticky situation you can’t get out of. So this must be 


THE END.

The station rattles and shakes around you. Your hands clutch the information 
counter so tightly your fingers cramp. A framed picture on the wall behind the 
clerk crashes to the floor. 

Get me out of here! 

You spin and dash out of the station. Your heart pounds and your breath 
comes in gasps as you race along the sidewalk. 

Whoops! Too bad you weren’t looking where you were going. Otherwise 
you would have seen the garbage truck before you landed in the middle of the 
gunk, the goo, and the gross slime. 

Eeeewwwww. Hold your nose and close the book quickly! You stink! 

You’ve come to a very smelly 


END!

“We’ll throw stuff at them.” You point to Grandma’s window. “From up 
there.” 

The aliens are busy eating and don’t notice you sneaking into the house. You 
race to Grandma’s room. “They’re all crowded together in that corner,” you cry, 
glancing out the window. “Even Grandma. We might be able to get them all at 
once!” 

“Let’s use this!” Andrew struggles to get the mattress off the bed. You and 
Sophie help him drag it to the window. 

“One! Two!” You strain to lift the mattress over the sill. “Three!” 

The mattress drops directly on top of the group of aliens. 


Did it work? Find out on PAGE 9.

You know what the letters spell! It’s so simple that you laugh at yourself for 
not getting it sooner. 

EMPLEH. Whoever wrote the message on the inside of the window didn’t 
realize it would be read backward on the outside. EMPLEH is HELP ME, 
written backward. You say it out loud. 

“What did you say, dear?” Grandma asks. “Do you need help with 
something?” 

You are about to tell her about the message when something you see inside 
the train stops you. You stare past the letters on the window and into the 
compartment. 

Your eyes widen. You blink several times. You take a step closer to the 
window. Your nose presses up against the glass. 

You don’t believe what you’re seeing! 


What has you glued to the train window? Find out on PAGE 98 .

“I bet nothing will happen,” you say. “I’m sure there’s a logical explanation 
for everything.” 

Before Sophie and Andrew can answer, the ground beneath your feet begins 
to rumble. 

“What’s going on?” Sophie cries. 

You glance up. Dozens of meteors shoot across the sky. They light up the 
night. You can see the garden clearly. 

And Grandma! 

She stands in the middle of the roses. By the light of the meteor shower, you 
watch Grandma reach up and pull off her face ! 

You hear Sophie and Andrew gasp beside you. But you can’t tear your eyes 
away. Grandma’s new face oozes and bubbles. A single yellow eye blinks in the 
center of her forehead. Her thick purple tail thrashes wildly. 

Surrounding her are dozens of purple pulsating eggs. The vibrations from the 
eggs make the ground shake. 

Grandma lets out a bone-chilling howl. 

Immediately, ah the eggs burst open! 


Turn to PAGE 43. 



16 

“Grandma!” you call again louder. “The roses!” 

Grandma dashes toward you. She spots the hose and yanks it out of the bush. 
It gushes water. 

“We have to turn it off in the garage,” you tell her. “And I don’t think I’m 
strong enough.” 

Grandma eyes you suspiciously. “Hmm,” she murmurs. 

But she heads for the garage. 

You follow right behind her, with your fingers crossed. 

Grandma enters the dark garage. You hold your breath. 

“Eeeeyah!” Sophie shrieks and leaps down from a stack of cartons. She 
lands right on top of Grandma. 

Andrew hurls himself onto the struggling pair. Sophie squeezes out from 
under Grandma and Andrew. Andrew wraps Grandma in your badminton net as 
they roll over and over. 

You rush over. You and Sophie hold Grandma as Andrew wiggles out of the 
net. 

Grandma stops struggling. “You never would have gotten away with this if it 
weren’t for this dinky human disguise!” she snarls. “You humans are so weak.” 

You drape your bicycle chain around her and snap the lock shut. “But we got 
the best of you!” you retort. 


Turn to PAGE 36.

“We’ll keep an eye on the eggs for you,” you tell Special Agent Bendrey. 

He gives a sharp nod. “Good. You should be safe if you act like you believe 
that woman is your real grandma,” he assures you. Then he takes off down the 
street. 

“Wait!” you call after him. He never told you what you’re supposed to do if 
the eggs hatch! But he’s gone. 

You, Sophie, and Andrew spend the rest of the afternoon up in your room. 
You take turns peering down at the garden. 

“Still nothing,” Sophie grumbles. “This is boring.” 

“Maybe it all ties in with the meteor shower tonight,” you suggest. “We’ll go 
downstairs right before it begins.” 

Later that evening, the three of you sneak out to the garden. Grandma is in 
the living room, watching TV. 

You flick on your flashlights. 

“Do we have our weapons?” you ask. 

Sophie hands you three water guns. You fill them with bug spray. Hey, it’s 
the best you can do on short notice. 

“Okay,” you announce. “We’re ready.” 


Wait for the meteor shower to begin on PAGE 124 .

You sigh. “The roses are great,” you answer politely. “Mom says they’re 
unusually large this year.” 

Grandma leans back in the car seat. “That is excellent.” 

“Why do you want to know about our garden?” you ask. 

She pats your hand. “I lived in the house before your mother and father did. 
And I planted the eggs in the garden.” 

“Eggs?” you repeat. “How could you plant eggs?” 

Grandma looks startled. “I meant seeds. I planted the seeds for the rose 
bushes.” 

“Those roses have been there as long as I can remember,” you remark. “You 
must have planted them a long time ago.” 

“Fifteen years ago,” Grandma tells you. “They’re the only roses planted by 
the light of shooting stars.” She chuckles. “Meteors, really. So many meteors 
fell, night turned into day.” 

The taxi pulls into your driveway. 

“I must see the roses right away!” Grandma leaps out of the cab and 
disappears around the back of the house. 

You stare after her. Was she always this weird? 

The driver pops open the trunk to get Grandma’s bags. He reaches in and 
tugs. And yanks. And grunts. And pulls.

“Alien investigator? Great joke!” You force a laugh. “Isn’t that funny, 
guys?” You turn to Sophie and Andrew, hoping they get what you’re doing. 
“Total laugh riot!” Sophie guffaws. 

“Had me in stitches,” Andrew adds. 

“Listen,” you say to Bendrey. “We have an appointment. We don’t have time 
for games.” You march briskly down the walk. 

“You’ll be sorry,” Bendrey calls after you. “You could really use my help!” 
You ignore him. You hurry down the street, Sophie and Andrew on your 
heels. 

“Are you sure ...?” Andrew begins. 

You glare at him, and he shuts up. 

Of course you’re not sure! you think. But you didn’t trust that special agent 

guy. 

You just hope you don’t regret refusing to speak to him. 


Turn to PAGE 25.

“I want to help find my real grandma!” you declare. 

“Good choice, kid.” Bendrey smiles at you. “Come on!” 

He leads you through town. In a few minutes, you, Sophie, Andrew, and 
Special Agent Bendrey stand outside an abandoned rail yard. One train car sits 
alone in the back of the yard. 

“The aliens dragged your grandma into the last train car,” Bendrey explains. 
“Then they unhooked the car from the one in front of it and brought it here.” 

You gaze at the nearly empty train yard. You shiver. Just being here gives 
you the creeps. Knowing aliens are inside that train car make your knees wobble 
with fear. 

“Let’s go!” Bendrey leads you, Sophie, and Andrew to a small opening in 
the fence. You crawl through and sneak toward the train car. The sun is setting, 
throwing weird shadows. Your heart pounds so hard, you’re afraid the aliens 
inside might hear it! 

Suddenly, the night sky brightens. 

“The meteor shower!” Sophie gasps. 

“Oh, no!” Bendrey exclaims. 

Why is he upset about the meteor shower? you wonder.

“Ticket?” you repeat. You smile up at the conductor. 

He doesn’t smile back. 

You spot Chuck and Ginny entering the compartment. Great! 

“Hi! I was looking for you!” You dart past the conductor and join your 
friends. “He wants to see my ticket,” you explain. You hope theyTl come up 
with an idea. Or some cash. 

“If you weren’t always late, you would have your ticket!” Ginny scolds. 
Then she winks at you. 

“That’s right,” Chuck tells the conductor. “My mom is picking us up in 
Evanstown. She’ll pay when we arrive.” 

“We promised our parents we wouldn’t get into trouble,” Ginny gushes. 

You want to gag. But Ginny’s act works. 

“Okay.” The conductor pats Ginny’s head. “As long as the ticket gets paid 
for.” He strolls out of the train car. 

“What was that about?” Chuck demands. “Why are you on the train? Aren’t 
you supposed to be with your grandmother?” 

You tell them about the strange scene you witnessed. 

“That woman might be my real grandma!” you exclaim. “You have to help 
me search the train!” 

Ginny and Chuck gaze at each other. “No way ...” Chuck begins. 


Your heart sinks all the way to PAGE 59 . 



22 

You don’t know what to do next. So you sit at the kitchen table and scarf 
down a few brownies. Then you glance out the window — and notice someone 
sneaking around your garage! 

“Come on!” you shout. You dash out the door. Andrew and Sophie follow on 
your heels. But you’re too late. The guy has already disappeared into the garage. 

You charge through the door. And gasp. 

Grandma has transformed! 

She’s covered in green scales and has sprouted seven arms and three heads. 
All three heads are smiling into the intmder’s video camera. 

“What’s going on?” you demand. 

“I’m interviewing your grandma,” the guy explains. “She’ll be a great 
story!” 

“Cookie!” Grandma scolds. “You’re in the way. You’ll block my best angle.” 

Best angle? With three heads, there are plenty of angles to choose from! 


Turn to PAGE 24. 




23 


You race to Grandma #2 in the doorway. 

“Keep away from us!” you shout at the other Grandma. Chuck and Ginny 
msh to your side. “You’re not my grandma!” 

Anger, then worry, flashes across Grandma #l’s face. “Wait! Don’t —” 

But you all charge out of the baggage car before she can say anything else. 

You and Grandma #2 get out at the next station. Ginny and Chuck continue 
on to the hockey game. 

“Grandma, you wouldn’t believe what was going on in that train!” you tell 
her as you wait for the train back home. “There were alien creatures with yellow 
Ping-Pong eyes and ...” 

You hear a strange gurgling sound beside you. You glance over at Grandma. 

No! It can’t be! 

Your stomach twists in fear and disgust. Grandma is peeling off her skin! A 
slimy mass of green pulsing flesh oozes underneath her Grandma face. 

Boy, oh, boy. Did you pick the wrong Grandma! 


THE END

“Your grandma was telling me all about her home planet,” the reporter tells 

you. 

“I’m so sorry I had to frighten you, dear,” she tells you. “But I really needed 
the publicity. For my new movie.” 

Huh? 

Seeing your confused look, all of Grandma’s heads laugh. “Everyone knows 
you’ve got to come to Earth to get your big break!” she explains. “Lots of 
celebrities do it!” 

“B-b-but —” you sputter. “What about the eggs in the rose garden? What 
about that fight we had when we captured you?” 

“That’s easy,” Grandma scoffs. “The eggs were a dandy lunch. And the 
fight, well ...” She shrugs. “I’m afraid I staged it. It was this young man’s idea.” 
She nods one head at the reporter. “He thought it would make a good lead-in. So, 
Cookie, what do you think of your grandma now?” 

Your head swims. “My grandma? Are you saying that I’m an alien like 
you?” 

You feel faint just asking the question. 


Grandma’s answer is on PAGE 122 . Well, what are you waiting for? 
Turn to the page!

Finally, you, Sophie, and Andrew arrive at the train station. The place is 
deserted. Your footsteps echo in the stillness as you trudge down the platform 
and into the station. 

Even the information booth is closed. 

“Now what?” Sophie asks. 

“I’m thinking! I’m thinking!” you snap. 

Andrew starts rubbing his head. Good. That means his brain is working. 
Maybe he’ll figure out what to do. 

You glance up and down the platform. A light in the distance begins getting 
larger. The platform begins to rumble. 

Train coming in! 

The train gives you an idea! You’ll ask the conductor for a train schedule. 
Then maybe you can figure out where Grandma’s train was headed. You explain 
your plan to Sophie and Andrew. 

“Whatever.” Sophie shrugs her shoulders. You can tell she doesn’t think it’s 
much of a plan. 

The train roars into the station. 

Now that’s strange, you think. No one is getting on. And no one is getting 
off. 


Turn to PAGE 39.

“It’s so nice to see my Cookie!” Your grandmother gazes down at you. Her 
eyes sparkle. Two dimples crinkle her cheeks as she smiles. 

You grin up at her. You must have imagined seeing that other woman. How 
could you have two grandmas? It’s a dumb idea. 


Get your grandma to a cab on PAGE 44 .

Maybe this guy can help you, you reason. But you need to be careful. After 
all, you brought home the wrong Grandma! 

“What do you mean — you’re an alien investigator?” you ask. 

The guy grins. “What does it sound like?” 

“So why did you ask about Grandma?” Sophie demands. 

Good question. You wish you had thought of it! 

Special Agent Bendrey glances around. “Because I know that the woman 
claiming to be your grandmother is an impostor!” 

Your mouth drops open. “How do you know?” 

Bendrey’s voice drops down to a low whisper. “Your real grandma is my 
partner!” 


Turn to PAGE 48.

“We’ve got to wake Grandma,” you tell the others. “We won’t be able to 
escape any other way.” 

You, Ginny, and Chuck rush over to Grandma. You rub her hands and pat her 
face lightly. Finally, she comes around. 

“My, my,” she murmurs. “What am I doing up here?” 

You describe everything that has happened. She clucks and shakes her head. 
“I was afraid they might be onto me.” 

Then Grandma tells you an amazing story. 

She’s a secret agent specializing in alien investigations! 

“I’ve been tracking the evil Mithra-Dithra,” she explains. “Obviously, she 
assumed my identity. That’s why you saw two of us at the train station. And why 
those creatures captured me.” 

Your head swims. This is unbelievable! 

But you know your grandma is telling you the truth. 

Grandma smiles at you. “You three did very well,” she says. “I have an 
assignment for you. If you dare.” 


If you accept the assignment, turn to PAGE 34 .

“Let’s see who’s on the other side of the door,” you tell Grandma. 

She nods. “On my signal.” 

Grandma aims the device at the center of the door. You reach for the handle. 
She nods again. 

You take a deep breath and yank open the door. 

“Aaaaaaaaah!” a boy shrieks, bursting into the bathroom. 

Wham! The door smashes into your knee. The pain makes you weak. 

The boy knocks into Grandma. The device flies from her hands — straight 
into the toilet. She falls against the wall. 

“Get out! Get out! Get out!” the boy hollers. 

You and Grandma are no match for him. 

When you gotta go, you gotta go! 


THE END

“There are two strangers at the back door,” Grandma says. “Get rid of them. 
We don’t need nosy neighbors poking around.” 

You glance out the window and smile. 

“Those are just my friends, Sophie and Andrew,” you assure her. “Hey, 
guys!” you call. 

Sophie and Andrew look up. Sophie is the toughest kid you know. She’s not 
afraid of anything. Bugs, snakes, rats — nothing scares her. You never, ever, dare 
her to do anything — because she’ll do it and then double-dare you! 

Andrew’s stringy brown hair sticks out in weird clumps. Whenever Andrew 
thinks hard about something, he rubs his head. So his hair is always a mess, 
because he never stops thinking. 

“Friends of yours?” Grandma murmurs. “I must meet them.” 

“Okay.” You lean back out the window. “Yo! Guys!” you yell. You’re about 
to tell them to come upstairs when Grandma grasps your arm. 

“Not now!” she orders. “I need to freshen up after my travels. Unpack. 
Maybe take a nap.” 

You rub your arm where she grabbed you. She’s one tough grandma!

“EMPLEH!” you tell Grandma excitedly. “It’s HELP ME spelled 
backward.” 

Grandma stares at you. 

“Grandma!” You tug at her sleeve. “We have to go back! Someone on the 
train needs our help!” 

“Oh, Cookie.” She sighs. “I didn’t want to have to do this so soon. But you 
give me no choice. I can’t allow you to interfere with my mission.” 

Grandma pulls a small laser device from her pocket. She points it at you. 

ZAP! 

“Take me to your mother’s rose garden,” she orders. 

You can’t resist. You lurch forward and climb into a cab like a zombie. As 
soon as you arrive at your house, Grandma races to the rose garden. 

“My eggs!” she cries. “My babies are ready to hatch!” 

You stand by watching helplessly as Grandma digs up hundreds of alien 
eggs.

Before you can shoot, the spidery creature speaks. In perfect English! 

“Thank you for rescuing us,” it chirps. 

“You’re — you’re ... welcome!” you stammer. 

“Your ‘grandma’ is an evil alien who kept us captive,” the creature explains. 
“You have released us from our prison shells. We owe you our lives. We will 
never leave you!” 

Say what? 

Special Agent Bendrey rushes out of your house. 

“While you were keeping an eye on the eggs, we snuck in and captured 
Grandma,” he tells you. “She’s in custody now. Thanks for your help.” He 
dashes off. 

“Wait!” you call after him. 

Too late. He’s gone. You never got to ask him one very important question. 

How are you going to explain the dozens of alien houseguests to your 
parents? 

Well, your mom is always telling you to make more friends.... 


THE END 

33 

You can’t go home without your grandma. Even if you feel as if you’re in 
the middle of an earthquake. 

You clutch the information counter to keep from falling over. You smile at 
the clerk, hoping to mask your fear. 

“Train coming!” the clerk informs you, shouting over the noise. “Every time 
one comes in, this old station rattles like a baby’s toy.” 

“I knew that,” you fib. You hope the clerk doesn’t notice how white your 
knuckles are. 

The rattling stops with a loud screech of brakes. You make your way out 
onto the platform just as the doors to the train open. Mobs of people push their 
way out the doors. 

You scan the crowd, searching for an old lady in yellow pants and a purple 
shirt. No luck. 

“Hey, what are you doing here?” a voice calls. 


Turn to PAGE 4.

Become an official investigator of aliens? 

“You bet!” you exclaim. Ginny and Chuck nod enthusiastically. 

“Great!” Grandma beams at you. “I’m going to go after Mithra-Dithra. But I 
need you to stay on this train.” 

You try to hide your disappointment. “Can’t we go with you to defeat the 
evil alien?” you ask. 

Grandma shakes her head. “I need you to track another set of aliens. You 
see, I discovered why there are so many aliens on this train. They’re all heading 
for a big meeting a few miles up.” 

Chuck lets out a low whistle. “Like some kind of alien convention?” he asks. 

“In a way.” Grandma smiles. “They meet every few years on a centrally 
located planet. This year, they’re coming to Earth.” 

Ginny shudders. “To do what?” 

Grandma leans forward. “That’s what I need you three to find out!” 


Arrive at the alien meeting on PAGE 38 .

“Ginny!” you shout. “Look out!” 

Ginny scrambles over a pile of smashed suitcases. She trips on a broken 
crate and sprawls on the floor. “Help me!” she shrieks. 

The yellow-eyed thugs stalk closer. 

Chuck crawls along the luggage rack, hurling down the few remaining 
boxes. The creatures are inches from Ginny. 

You have to help her! You swing your legs over the side of the rack and drop 
to the floor. “Leave her alone!” you scream. 

The door behind you flies open. The conductor bursts in. 

Great! You might have a chance now. 

“Help us!” you beg the startled conductor. “You’ve got to help us, please!” 

Your heart stops as his head explodes! Right in front of you! 


Scream in terror all the way to PAGE 40 . 




36 


You, Sophie, and Andrew run out of the garage. 

“We did it!” Sophie cries. “We actually captured an alien!” 

“We’ll be heroes!” Andrew crows. 

But you can’t join in the celebration. You’ve just thought of something. 
Something terrifying. 

Sophie and Andrew dance around on the lawn. Then they notice your face. 

“What’s wrong with you?” Andrew demands. “We had a great plan and it 
worked perfectly. We got the alien!” 

“Yes, we did,” you say slowly. “But there are still all of those.” You point to 
the rose garden. 

The rose garden filled with purple pulsing eggs. 

“Grandma called the roses her babies!” you explain. “Those must be her 
alien children. And I think they’re about to hatch!” 

Sophie gasps. “If they hatch, we’ll be totally outnumbered.” 

“Should we call the authorities right now?” you ask them. “Or do we figure 
out something to do with the eggs?” 

Andrew and Sophie don’t say a word. They just stare at you. 

So it’s up to you. 


Call the authorities on PAGE 49. 


Deal with the eggs on PAGE 115 . 





37 


You can’t believe what this creature is saying. Your grandmother — an 
alien? No way! 

The creature that used to be the conductor squeezes you tighter in its 
tentacles. Pieces of its human disguise drip down its uniform. “Now that we 
have the child, perhaps Mithra-Dithra will be more cooperative,” it says. 

“Who’s Mithra-Dithra?” you ask. 

One of the thugs makes a sound you assume is an alien laugh. “Your 
grandmother has taught you well.” 

“Yes,” the other thug agrees. “But we won’t be fooled. And your 
grandmother, Mithra-Dithra, will not succeed in her evil plan to rule this solar 
system.” 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about!” you yell. “My grandmother’s first 
name is Susan, not Mithra-Dithra.” 

“You’ve made a mistake!” Ginny protests. “Just because the old lady dresses 
funny, it doesn’t mean she’s an alien!” 

The three creatures fix their yellow eyes on you. They make that weird 
laughing noise again. 

“You will answer our questions soon enough. Now we must prepare.” 

Prepare for what? 


Find out what they plan to do with you on PAGE 83 .

You, Ginny, and Chuck arrive at the alien meeting. Grandma has given each 
of you a disguise. You think your two blue heads look really cool! 

But, unfortunately, this assignment turns out to be totally boring. 

It really is a convention. These aliens get together to vote on galaxy parking 
rules, real estate taxes, and planetary trade pacts. 

It’s so dull, both of your blue heads fall asleep. The five-armed orange 
security guard has to throw you out. Your snoring is disturbing the guest speaker. 

Oh, well. Sometimes even aliens turn out to be dull in 


THE END.

“Let’s get on board,” you say. “We’ll track down a conductor.” 

You, Sophie, and Andrew board the train. You slide open the door and enter 
the first car. 

And stop. 

A chill of horror runs along your spine. Your fingers tremble with fear. 

“They’re — they’re —” Andrew stammers. 

“Ghosts!” you whisper. 

The train car is filled with shimmering figures, each more horrifying than the 
last. Heads float by without bodies. Bodies float by without heads. Skeletons 
move up and down the aisle. Wispy, cloudy girls and boys hover a few inches off 
the ground. 

You reach for the door handle. It won’t budge! And the train begins to move! 

“We’re trapped!” you shriek. 

If only you had stayed home and listened to Special Agent Bendrey. Because 
compared to these ghouls, an alien is nothing! 

And now you’re stuck on this train going nowhere. 

That is, nowhere you want to go! 

Let’s put it this way: Now that you’re on the ghost train, this adventure has 
definitely come to 


THE END. 



40 


“Aaahhhhhhh!” you shriek in horror. 

Chuck falls to the ground, shaking with fear. Ginny sinks into the pile of 
bags. 

You can’t tear your eyes away from the terrifying sight. Flesh-colored globs 
splat onto the floor. Pieces of the conductor’s face dangle around his neck. 

But even more revolting is the disgusting new head that rises from his 
conductor’s collar. A hairless, misshapen skull with lidless eyes. Yellow eyes. 
The size of Ping-Pong balls. 

Tentacles shoot out from his sleeves. One wraps around your arm. The other 
grabs Ginny. A third bursts from the center of his chest. Right through the 
conductor’s uniform. It yanks Chuck to his feet. 

The tentacle is working its way up your arm toward your face. You’ve got to 
do something! But what? 


If you punch the creature with your free hand, turn to PAGE 67 . 
If you bite the tentacles as hard as you can, turn to PAGE 47 . 





41 


“It’s more than Grandma’s weird behavior,” you explain. “It’s a feeling I 
have.” 

Andrew and Sophie laugh. “Oh, excuse me,” Sophie teases. “I didn’t realize 
you had a feeling !” 

“We all know how reliable those feelings are!” Andrew adds. 

“Guys!” You run your hands through your hair. “I’m serious.” 

“Don’t freak,” Sophie consoles you with a laugh. “We think you’re nuts, but 
we’ll still help you.” 

“Yeah!” Andrew nods. “Spying will be fun! What’s the plan?” 

Plan? You haven’t thought of one yet. You gaze out the kitchen window at 
Grandma in the garden. 

“Maybe we should watch Grandma and try to figure out what she’s doing in 
the rose garden,” you suggest. 

“Okay.” Andrew and Sophie head for the door. 

Then you have another idea. “Or maybe we should search her room.” 

Andrew and Sophie gaze at you. “She’s your grandmother,” Andrew says. 
“Make up your mind.” 


You heard Andrew. Choose! 

Spy on Grandma in the garden on PAGE 79 . 
Search her room on PAGE 53. 




42 

You glance at Bendrey. 

Your mouth drops open in horror. 

By the bright light of the meteor rays you can clearly see Special Agent 
Bendrey. He’s transforming in front of you! 

Stalks shoot out from his face. Clusters of eyeballs dangle from the stalks! 
His head becomes a massive skull, as his human skin slithers off and drips to the 
ground. 

“Nooooo!” Sophie shrieks. 

You’re too terrified to make a sound. 

Or to run. 

Three creatures exactly like Bendrey burst through the train car door. They 
quickly drag you and your friends inside. 

“Sorry,” Bendrey apologizes to the other creatures. “I tried to get back 
before the meteors hit, but these kids delayed me.” 

“No problem,” one of the gross creatures responds. “We know just how to 
handle them.” It grins. 

When Special Agent Bendrey told you he was an alien investigator, he didn’t 
mean he investigated aliens. He meant he was an alien who investigated. 

Too bad you didn’t investigate his story. Because now you’re about to come 
to a gruesome 


END! 



43 


The ground shakes so violently that you, Sophie, and Andrew are thrown 
down. You stay low, too terrified to move. 

Dozens of miniature versions of the gross Grandma burst from the eggs. The 
purple flesh doesn’t look any better baby-sized. If anything, you think, the young 
ones are more disgusting! 

Grandma still hasn’t seen you. All the newly hatched creatures line up in 
front of her. 

“My children,” she addresses them. “We have traveled to this galaxy to take 
over this world. You know what you must do. First, feed and grow. Next, fit 
yourselves out with human body parts.” She holds up one of the rubber masks 
that you saw in her room earlier. “And then,” she finishes with a hideous cackle, 
“go forth and carry out the Master Plan!” 

You, Sophie, and Andrew all wear the same look of horror on your faces. 

“We’ve got to stop them! Do you think we can fight them right here?” 

Sophie whispers. 

“No way. Let’s go tell my parents,” Andrew urges. “We need help!” 


To fight the aliens, turn to PAGE 88 . 
Tell Andrew’s parents on PAGE 94 . 





44 


“Let me help you with those.” You reach for one of Grandma’s two large 
suitcases. 

Grandma shakes her head. “No, no. I’m perfectly balanced. If you take one 
I’ll probably topple over.” She giggles. “Now, that would be a sight!” 

You lead her out of the railroad station and to a taxi. Grandma shoves her 
suitcases into the trunk and then climbs into the cab beside you. 

“Give the driver your address,” she instructs, “and then tell me all about 
yourself.” 

You do as she says. But as you launch into a long story about your brilliant 
performance at school yesterday, she interrupts you. 

“Tell me about the rose garden!” Grandma demands. 


Try not to be annoyed and turn to PAGE 18 . 




45 


Alien babies burst from the purple shells. They crawl everywhere, oozing 
yellow slime. Grandma dances around crazily. 

“My plans to take over the universe will now come true!” Grandma cries. 
“My babies will be my army! No one will be able to stop us.” 

One little alien baby slithers over to you. It slides across your foot. It glances 
up and all five of its eyes gaze at you. It squeaks. 

Hey! 

It’s kind of cute. 

You pick it up. It makes a sound like a cat purring. 

Oh, well. If aliens are going to rule Earth, it would probably be a good idea 
to have at least one alien on your side. Maybe then you won’t come to such a 
terrifying 


THE END. 


46 

Are you kidding? 

You’re turning down the chance to have a close encounter of the alien kind? 
You’d rather go home than spy on creatures from outer space? 

Boy. 

You sure aren’t the kind of kid who usually reads GIVE YOURSELF 
GOOSEBUMPS. 

Maybe you should go get your baby brother’s nursery rhymes. Pick this 
book up again when you stop being such a wimp! 

THE END

It would be useless to hit the powerful creature. Your fist is too small. It 
would feel like a gnat slugging an elephant. 

But can you do it? Can you actually sink your teeth into that slimy tentacle? 

You have no choice. It’s wrapping around your throat. 

You shut your eyes and chomp down on the squirming flesh. 

Hmmm. Not bad. Kind of tastes like chicken. 

You dig your teeth in deeper. The creature howls and drops Ginny and 
Chuck. You hang on with your teeth. Flailing tentacles smash into the walls and 
the ceiling. The two other creatures duck out of the way as the tentacles flip 
around. 

CRASH! A strange-looking piece of equipment falls to the floor. The orange 
light instantly shuts off. 

The ex-conductor’s tentacles must have smashed the light that makes the 
force field, you realize. You glance at Grandma. 

She blinks three times. She looks dazed. 

The tentacled conductor-creature shrieks and writhes. But the two other 
creatures leap toward your grandma. 

You release your teeth from the tentacle. “No!” you holler. 


Turn to PAGE 95. 



48 

“My grandma is a special agent, too?” You’re so shocked, your voice 
squeaks. 

“Exactly,” Bendrey tells you. “We’ve been tracking an alien who we believe 
has assumed your grandmother’s identity.” 

“Why would anyone impersonate my grandma?” Your head is spinning. 

Bendrey shrugs. “To find out how much we know? To feed us false 
information? It could be anything.” 

“Why is the alien here?” Andrew asks. 

“We’re not sure,” Bendrey replies. “The alien planted eggs in the rose 
garden here. We suspect they’re about to hatch.” 

You shudder. Sophie’s face has grown pale. Andrew looks like he’s ready to 
throw up. 

“I need your help,” Bendrey continues. “We know where they’ve taken your 
grandma. The trouble is, the aliens who captured her know me. But you may be 
able to sneak into their headquarters.” 

Your mouth suddenly goes dry. “Me?” you choke out. 

“Or,” Bendrey goes on, “you can keep an eye on the eggs.” 

Both choices sound terrifying. But you have to pick one!

“The eggs can wait,” you decide. “We don’t know how long that badminton 
net will hold Grandma. We should turn her over to the authorities before we do 
anything else.” 

You, Sophie, and Andrew head back into the house. You grab the phone in 
the kitchen. You pause, uncertain. “Who do I call?” you ask. 

“No alien hotline in the phone book, huh?” Sophie jokes. 

“My mom says to call 911 if there’s an emergency,” Andrew suggests. 

“An alien in the garage qualifies as an emergency,” you declare. You punch 
in the numbers. 

Unfortunately, the emergency operator doesn’t believe you. When she stops 
laughing, she scolds you for tying up the line. “Someone could be trying to 
phone in a real emergency!” she reprimands you. 

“This is a real emergency!” you insist. But it’s too late. She’s already hung 
up. 

You slam down the phone. “Now what?” you mutter. 


Turn to PAGE 22.

You’ve entered the baggage compartment. But luggage isn’t what has the 
three of you frozen in place, eyes wide. 

Your grandmother sits on a chair surrounded by suitcases. She gazes straight 
ahead, unblinking. A strange orange light beams down onto her. She doesn’t 
move. And although her eyes are open, she doesn’t seem to see you. 

“Is she ... is she ... you know ...?” Ginny stammers. 

“I can’t tell,” you reply. “I think she’s alive, but...” 

“I know a way to find out!” Chuck says. He jumps up and down, puts his 
fingers up his nose, and howls in Grandma’s ear. 

No reaction from Grandma. You swallow hard. 

“Wait. She is alive!” Ginny murmurs, creeping closer. “I can see her 
breathing.” 

“Then why doesn’t she say something?” you worry aloud. 

“Maybe she’s under some kind of spell,” Ginny whispers. 

“Maybe it’s this weird light,” Chuck suggests. He waves a hand into the 
orange beam. 

POW! Chuck’s body flies across the railroad car. He lands in a crumpled 
heap on top of a suitcase. 


Find out if Chuck is okay on PAGE 77 .

“The alien is an impostor!” you exclaim. “She’s done something with my 
real grandma. We have to save her!” 

You explain to Sophie and Andrew about seeing the other woman on the 
train. 

“We have to go back to the train station.” You start climbing out of the tree 
house. 

“Do you really think she’ll still be there?” Sophie asks. 

The question stops you. You cling to the tree trunk. 

Maybe going to the train station is a dumb idea. But it’s the only idea you 
have. “What else can we do?” you demand. “At least it’s a place to start.” 

You scurry the rest of the way down and land with a soft thud on the grass. 
Sophie and Andrew drop down beside you. The three of you sneak around the 
side of the house. No sign of Grandma! 

You dash across your front lawn. 

CRRRRACKKK! 

You glance up. Something moved in that tree! 


Who — or what! — made that sound? Find out on PAGE 6. 




52 


You rush to Grandma #1 and assume a martial-arts position just like hers. 

“How could you, Cookie?” Grandma #2 wails. “Why would you choose that 
fiend over me, your sweet ol’ grandma?” 

“My parents told me my grandma was unusual,” you explain. “And full of 
surprises.” 

“That certainly describes me!” Grandma #1 boasts. 

“And I don’t think my real grandma would call me that terrible nickname. 
Especially since I’m not a little kid anymore!” you finish. 

Ginny and Chuck slap high fives. “Way to go!” Chuck cheers. 

“Sorry,” Grandma #1 tells the other Grandma. “But don’t feel too bad about 
not being believed. The original is always better than the copy.” 

Huh? What’s she talking about? 

Before you can ask, three more women charge through the door. 

More Grandmas! 


Turn to PAGE 8.

“This would be a good chance to find out more about Grandma/’ you tell 
Sophie and Andrew. “Let’s search her room.” 

“Right, chief.” Sophie salutes you. 

You all trudge up to Grandma’s room. The door is shut. 

Glancing around, you quickly turn the doorknob. Then the three of you slip 
inside. 

You gaze around the room. It just looks like an ordinary bedroom. 

Andrew fidgets beside you. “We should hurry,” he urges. “I don’t want to get 
caught in here.” 

He’s right. 

But where do you begin?

“Is something wrong?” a voice asks behind you. 

You turn and face your grandmother standing on the platform. She and the 
woman on the train could be twins! What’s going on? 

Is this woman really your grandmother? Or is your real grandmother in 
terrible trouble on the train? 

“Shouldn’t we be getting a taxi, Cookie?” 

You stare at her. Could you have made a mistake? 

“All aboard,” the conductor shouts. The train lets out an exhausted wheeze, 
then slowly pulls forward. 

You could jump on the train now and find out if the woman in danger is your 
real grandma. Or you could assume the woman standing in front of you is the 
right woman. After all, she recognized you — and you didn’t get a good look at 
the woman on the train. 

It’s now or never. What are you going to do?

“Stay away from her!” the new Grandma warns. “She’s evil!” 

“Don’t listen to her,” the other Grandma yells. “She’s an impostor!” 

Your head spins. Ginny’s gaze shoots back and forth between the identical 
Grandmas. Chuck stares with his mouth open so wide you can see the rubber 
bands on the inside of his braces. 

Grandma #1 — the one who fought the three creatures — leaps into her 
martial-arts stance again. “Don’t mess with me,” she snarls. 

The new Grandma — Grandma #2 — cowers by the door to the baggage 
compartment. “Oh, no!” she whimpers. “She’s going to get me. She’ll get all of 
us!” 

“Shut up, you fake!” Grandma #1 snaps. “These kids are too smart to fall for 
your act. Right?” 

She gazes straight at you.

“Refrigeration is the way to go,” you decide. 

You, Sophie, and Andrew gather up the eggs. It takes you each three trips to 
get them all into the house. 

By eating the leftover plate of chicken, throwing out the brussels sprouts, 
and rearranging the milk and juice, you manage to fit all the eggs into the 
refrigerator. By the time you’re done, it’s dark outside. 

“Uh, guys,” you say to Sophie and Andrew. “Not that I’m scared or 
anything, but would you mind sleeping over?” 

They must understand how you’re feeling. They don’t even tease you. They 
just exchange a nervous look and say yes. 

The next morning the sun streams through your bedroom window. You 
stretch, wiggling your toes and fingers. 

Then you freeze. Your heart pounds hard in your chest. 

Noises. Noises downstairs. 


Turn to PAGE 60. 




57 


“I’ve got an idea,” you whisper. 

You outline your plan to Chuck and Ginny. “Wait for my signal,” you say. 
They nod. 

You grab a small box lying beside you and toss it to the other side of the 
compartment. The creatures’ heads whip around. Their bodies tense and they 
move toward the noise. 

“Now!” you shout. You and Chuck jump up and grab the rungs of the 
overhead luggage rack. With a grunt, you swing up onto the rack. Bags and 
boxes tip over, landing on top of the thugs. 

Chuck clambers up beside you. Together, you bury the creeps with luggage. 
Ginny pelts them with parcels and bags. 

“We’re winning!” you cry. “Keep throwing!” 

Suitcases burst open as they hit the ground. Clothes fly everywhere. Bottles 
shatter and tubes ooze, spilling their contents all over the floor. But even in the 
chaos, your grandma sits staring straight ahead, imprisoned by the orange light. 

“Rrrraaagghhhhhhh!” With a deafening roar the creatures explode out of the 
pile of luggage. They head straight for Ginny. 

“Oh, no!” you shriek. Your eyes dart along the empty luggage racks. “We’ve 
run out of ammunition!” 


Hurry to PAGE 35 . 



58 

“Look at this!” you whisper. 

Sophie and Andrew pop their heads up over the side of the tree house. 

Grandma holds up another throbbing purple egg. She puts her free hand in 
her mouth. When she pulls it back out her index finger has turned lime green! A 
metal tip as sharp as a pin extends where her nail should be. 

That’s not a human finger, you realize. 

Grandma sticks the metal tip into the pulsing egg. It throbs faster. Then it 
glows, as if it were lit up from inside. 

Satisfied, Grandma lays the egg back down on the ground. Then she moves 
onto the next rose bush. Soon she makes her way through the entire garden and 
heads back to the house. 

Andrew and Sophie stare at you. 

“I hate to have to say this ...,” Andrew begins. 

“Your grandma is — she’s, I mean, I think —” Sophie tries. 

You nod miserably. “I know,” you say. “My grandma is an alien!” 


Turn to PAGE 69.

“No way are we going to miss out on an adventure like this!” Ginny finishes 
for Chuck. 

“Great!” you cry. You quickly explain that you were about to check out the 
train cars in the direction the thugs dragged your grandma. Or the Grandma- 
impostor. Whoever. 

“What are we waiting for!” Chuck urges. “Let’s go!” 

The three of you hurry into the next car. And then the car after that. And then 
the car after that. 

“Are you sure of what you saw?” Ginny asks. “I mean, why would two 
tough guys go after somebody’s grandmother?” 

“Maybe it was just a coincidence that the two ladies were wearing the same 
clothes,” Chuck adds. 

“No! I know what I saw!” you insist. But inside, you wonder the same thing. 

You arrive at the last car. On the door is a yellow sign with large black 
letters: no entry. 

You notice Ginny and Chuck exchange a worried look. Before they can 
change their minds about helping you, you yank open the door. The three of you 
pile into the car. 

You gasp, stunned by the shocking sight in front of you. 


What’s going on? Find out on PAGE 50 .

You leap out of bed, trying to avoid stepping on Sophie and Andrew in their 
sleeping bags. “Wake up!” you whisper. “There’s something moving around 
downstairs.” 

Sophie’s eyes widen. “Grandma!” 

“The eggs!” Andrew gulps. 

You, Sophie, and Andrew sneak downstairs. You huddle outside the kitchen 
door. “On three,” you instruct them. “One. Two.” Your voice shakes with fear.” 

You gulp. “Three!” 

With a shout, the three of you charge into the kitchen. 


Who ’s there ? Turn to PAGE 90.

Wham! Your landing knocks the wind out of you. You roll several yards. 
You can feel every rock through your clothes. 

As you struggle to get up, you notice Grandma is already on her feet. She’s 
speaking into her watch! You dash over. She smiles. 

“We’ll be out of here in no time!” she tells you. 

Within minutes a helicopter is hovering over you. Your hair whips in the 
wind created by the rotating blades. 

A rope ladder is tossed down. Grandma grabs a rung and scrambles up. You 
follow a few feet behind her. 

As Grandma nears the helicopter door, she stops. 

“Uh-oh,” she mutters. 

You don’t like the sound of that. 


Turn to PAGE 121.

You stride to one of the closets. “This seems like a good place to start,” you 
announce. You fling open the door. 

And gasp! 

“What is it?” Sophie asks, her voice trembling. 

You turn to her, a terrified look on your face. “Grandma’s other clothes are 
even uglier than her purple-and-yellow outfit!” 

Sophie punches your arm. “That’s not funny!” 

Andrew laughs. “Yeah, it is!” He steps into the closet and pushes aside the 
row of clothes hanging from the rod. 

And gasps. 

You snort. “Andrew, we’re not going to fall for that now!” 

“It wasn’t funny the first time!” Sophie adds. 

“I’m not being funny,” Andrew tells you. He points to the back of the closet. 

You peer beyond him. There, sitting on the shelves, is a shoebox 
overflowing with ... hands. 

Human hands! 


Turn to PAGE 118.

“She’s seen us!” you yell. “We’ve got to get out of here!” You grab 
Andrew’s hands and help him out of the snarl of roses. Sophie crawls out from 
under a bush. 

“Everybody okay?” you ask. 

“No permanent damage,” Sophie replies. Andrew nods. 

“Then let’s move it!” 

You turn to run. And trip over a tangle of roots. The bushes are so thick that 
you can’t see Grandma. But you can hear her. She’s come out of the house. She’s 
just outside the garden. 

You scramble to your feet. You push aside a clump of roses. 

And come face to face with a pair of eyes. 

Eyes in the middle of a big fat rose! 


Yikes! Hurry to PAGE 103 .

You land on the small platform between train compartments. You flail your 
arms as you struggle to regain your balance. Once you feel steady on your feet, 
you fling the door open. 

Everyone stares at you as you enter the car. You nervously run a hand 
through your hair. You try to act as if jumping between the cars of a moving train 
is the most natural thing in the world. 

You have a feeling you’re not very convincing. 

You hurry into the next car. 

The struggling woman was several cars ahead. You head through the 
swaying train, planning to pick up the woman’s trail from where you’d last seen 
her. 

But maybe you’re in over your head. Those thugs in dark glasses looked 
dangerous. Maybe you need help.

Grandma said she planted the roses during a meteor shower. But she never 
mentioned that a meteor landed in the garden! 

Didn’t she notice? 

“Let’s look for pieces of the meteor,” Sophie suggests. 

“I don’t think we’ll be able to recognize meteor fragments,” you caution her. 
“They’ll just look like regular rocks.” 

“We should search anyway,” Sophie insists. 

You know better than to argue with Sophie. 

You, Andrew, and Sophie head out the back door. 

You’re surprised to see Grandma kneeling in the rose garden. She’s changed 
out of her purple-and-yellow outfit into an even stranger one — a shiny silver 
jumpsuit. 

“I thought she was taking a nap,” you murmur. 

“Is that your grandmother?” Andrew asks. 

“I think so ...,” you answer uncertainly. 

Sophie laughs. “What do you mean? Don’t you know your own 
grandmother?” 

Right now, you’re not so sure.... 


Turn to PAGE 75.

There’s barely room under the bed for all of Grandma’s things and the three 
of you. But somehow you fit. 

“You’re squashing me!” Sophie complains. 

“Shh!” you hiss. 

From under the bed, you can see Grandma’s shoes enter the room. She kicks 
them off. Then she moves to a corner of the room you can’t see. But you can 
hear her humming to herself. 

A moment later you see a bizarre sight! 

You still hear Grandma. But what you see is a long, purple, scaly tail! 

You’re so startled, you gasp. 

Sophie and Andrew immediately clap their hands over your mouth. 


Did Grandma hear you? Turn to PAGE 11 . 




67 


No way! You’re not putting that slimy tentacle in your mouth. Instead, you 
punch the creature’s face with all your strength. 

“Yeeoowwwwww!” you yelp. That hurt! 

The creature doesn’t even blink. It wraps you, Ginny, and Chuck even tighter 
in its tentacles. 

“Alien being,” one of the other yellow-eyed creatures addresses you. “We 
have come to destroy your evil grandmother’s eggs. We have tracked her 
through the galaxy for thirty years, hoping she would lead us to her nest.” 

Ginny gasps. “‘Through the galaxy’?” she echoes. “They—they’re saying 
that they’re aliens!” 

Your head spins. That’s not all. They’re saying something even more 
unbelievable! 

“Wh-what?” you sputter. “Are you saying my grandmother is an alien?” 


Turn to PAGE 37. 




68 


You wait. 

Nothing happens. 

Phew! You let out your breath. The creatures must have left. You’re safe. 

“Are you okay?” Chuck asks, rushing over. You sit up and untangle the 
packing twine that wraps around your ankle. 

“We better move fast,” Ginny warns. “That crash was really loud. Someone 
might come to see what it was.” 

“Yeah,” Chuck agrees. He helps you lift the mirror back upright. Luckily, it 
didn’t break. “So how are we going to break through the orange force field and 
grab your grandma?” 

You scratch your head. “Hmmmmm,” you murmur. Then the mirror gives 
you an idea. 


How will a mirror help you? Find out on PAGE 71 . 




69 


You sit in silence, too stunned to think. 

“Shouldn’t we do something?” Sophie asks finally. 

“Yes!” Andrew chimes in. “Let’s call the police!” 

“And tell them what?” you demand. “There’s an alien in my yard digging up 
purple eggs and poking them with a green fingernail?” You snort. “Would you 
believe that story?” 

“I guess not,” Andrew admits. 

“I know what we have to do!” Sophie says. “We have to capture your 
grandma. Then we’ll torture her until she spills her guts!” 


Whoa! Is Sophie serious? Turn to PAGE 114 . 



70 

Those thugs looked dangerous, you decide. You need help. 

You glance around the train car. Three kids reading comic books. A fat man 
sleeping. A teenage girl doing homework. Not much to choose from. 

You approach the teenage girl. “Excuse me,” you whisper. “I need your 
help.” 

The girl doesn’t look up. “I’m busy!” she snaps. 

You try again. “I saw a fight. And I —” 

“Look!” She sighs. “I have an A average. I’m not going to blow it by 
messing up on this exam. Go away!” 

Well, that was useless. 

“Did you say you saw a fight?” 

You turn at the sound of the deep voice. Looming over you is a man in an 
overcoat and sunglasses. 

“Light? Light?” you babble. “Oh, uh, yeah. Last night. A boxing match on 
TV!” 

You can’t see the man’s eyes behind his sunglasses. You’re not sure if he 
believes you. But he nods and walks away. 

You head toward the end of the car, searching for someone to help you. As 
you pass the bathroom, the door pops open. An arm reaches out and yanks you 
inside. 


Turn to PAGE 72. 




71 


“Help me with this thing,” you instruct Chuck and Ginny. Together, the three 
of you unwrap the large mirror. Then you carry it over to your frozen grandma. 

“If we find the right angle,” you explain, “we should be able to deflect the 
beams of the force field.” 

“What are you doing in here?” a voice demands behind you. 

Your head whips around. 

They’re back! The two thugs in overcoats and sunglasses! 


Think fast! Turn to PAGE 128 . 




72 


You’re shocked when you discover who dragged you into the tiny bathroom. 

“Grandma!” you exclaim. 

She claps her hand over your mouth. “Shhhh!” she hisses. 

You struggle to breathe. She’s incredibly strong. 

“I’m going to take my hand away,” she tells you. “Do you promise to be 
quiet?” 

Your lungs feel as if they’re about to explode. You nod. 

“Good.” Grandma releases you. “Sorry about that. But we can’t risk being 
found.” 

“Who are those guys?” you demand. “Why are they after you?” 

Grandma sighs. “I guess you need to know. You’re in up to your neck, right 
along with me.” 

Yikes! 


Listen to Grandma on PAGE 91. 




73 


“We better try to capture the alien,” you decide. “It’s the only way we’ll be 
able to get someone to believe us.” 

“And help us,” Andrew adds with a shudder. “But how?” 

“There are three of us and only one alien,” Sophie points out. “Maybe we 
can knock her out and lock her up.” 

It’s the best idea anyone can come up with. “You two hide in the garage,” 
you instruct your friends. “I’ll find some way to lure Grandma there. Then you’ll 
jump her. That way, we have surprise on our side.” 

“Sounds good,” Andrew says. Sophie nods in agreement. 

The three of you rush to the garage. You drum your fingers on the door, 
trying to think of a way to get Grandma to follow the plan. 

What would attract Grandma’s attention? you wonder. Then it hits you. The 
roses! Of course! She’ll definitely come running if something threatens her 
precious roses. 

You grab the garden hose and turn it on full blast. Then you drag the 
spurting hose out to the rose garden. You shove it into a large bush. Water sprays 
everywhere. 

“Grandma!” you shout. “Come quick! The roses are drowning!” 


Will Grandma fall for your plan? Find out on PAGE 16 .

You poke your head up and peer over the trunks. 

Two thugs in overcoats and sunglasses enter the baggage car. The same guys 
you saw fighting with your grandma! 

Yikes! Did you say “guys”? When they remove their dark glasses you 
discover they aren’t “guys” at all! Not human guys, anyway. 

Their eyes! They’re the size of Ping-Pong balls and glow a creepy yellow. 
Like lizards, they have no eyelids. 

Chills of terror make your fingers and toes tingle. 

You slink back down behind the trunks. “We’re in terrible danger,” you 
whisper to Ginny and Chuck. 

Chuck gulps. “Let’s wait until they leave, then grab your grandma and 
scram,” he urges. 

“How are we supposed to grab her through the force field?” Ginny demands. 
“It almost fried you.” 

“Then maybe we should overpower those creeps,” Chuck suggests. “There 
are two of them and three of us.” 

Chuck and Ginny can’t agree. They want you to decide. 


If you attack the yellow-eyed creatures, turn to PAGE 57 .

You stare at the woman in the rose garden. The woman who claims to be 
your grandmother. You think back to the train station. Your mother’s strange 
phone call. 

Could the Grandma in the garden be an impostor? 

“She looks cool!” Sophie interrupts your thoughts. “Introduce us.” 

Maybe you should tell Sophie and Andrew your suspicions. They can help 
you keep an eye on her. Try to figure out if she’s who she says she is. 

Or maybe you’re just being silly! After all, why would anyone impersonate 
your grandmother? 

And she did say she wanted to meet your friends. 


If you introduce Andrew and Sophie to Grandma, turn to PAGE 84 . 
If you spy on her first, turn to PAGE 78 . 




76 

You kneel down to peer under the bed. “No wonder Grandma’s suitcases 
were so heavy,” you remark. “There’s a lot of junk under here.” 

Sophie and Andrew help you drag stuff out from under the bed. But you 
can’t figure out what any of it is! Strange boxes that don’t seem to open. Bottles 
filled with strange liquids. You examine something that looks like a laptop. The 
keys have weird squiggles instead of letters. 

The only things you recognize are the two empty suitcases. 

“What are these things?” Sophie asks. You shake your head. You reach for 
the computer-like object. 

And freeze! 

Footsteps! 


Hide under the bed on PAGE 66. 




77 


“Chuck!” you shriek. You race to his side. He’s out cold. 

Ginny kneels beside you. “What happened to him?” she cries. 

“The orange light. It must be a force field of some kind,” you answer. 

“That’s why Grandma can’t move.” 

Ginny’s frightened eyes meet yours. “What are we going to do now?” she 
asks. 

You wish you knew what to tell her. 

“Whoa, what happened?” Chuck murmurs. His eyes blink open. “Who hit 
me?” 

You and Ginny help him to his feet. “It wasn’t a ‘who,’” you explain. “It was 
a ‘what.’” You point to the orange force field. 

“I never knew light could feel so solid.” Chuck rubs his face groggily. 

“We better keep out of sight while we decide what to do,” you suggest. “No 
telling who’ll come in.” 

Chuck and Ginny nod their agreement. The three of you duck behind a set of 
large trunks. 

Just in time. 

You hear the door slide open. 


Turn to PAGE 74.

Grandma makes you nervous. You want to find out more about her. 

“I’ll introduce you later,” you tell Sophie and Andrew. “Right now, there’s 
something you need to help me with.” 

You lead them back into the house. Sitting at the kitchen table, you quickly 
describe all the strange things you’ve noticed about Grandma since she’s been 
here. 

Sophie snorts. “So your grandmother is stronger than you. What’s the big 
deal?” 

“And my mom is always mixing up words,” Andrew adds. “Half the time 
she calls me by my sister’s name. So what if your grandma said eggs instead of 
seeds ? 

You sigh. They don’t believe you. 


Turn to PAGE 41 . 




79 


“Let’s find out what Grandma’s doing in the garden,” you say. 

“Won’t she notice us?” Andrew asks. 

You gaze out the kitchen window. “The tree house!” you exclaim. “We can 
spy on her from there.” 

Sophie slaps you a high five. “Great plan!” 

You, Sophie, and Andrew dart out the door. You scurry up the tree trunk. At 
the top you pull yourself onto the platform. Andrew and Sophie flop down 
beside you on the weathered planks. 

You peer down at Grandma. She moves slowly through the rows of roses, 
stopping at each one. 

Sophie fakes a yawn. “Wake me when something exciting happens.” 

Grandma kneels beside a rose bush and gently brushes soil away from the 
roots. Then, very carefully, she brings something up from under the ground. 

A huge purple egg! 

You gasp. Grandma did plant eggs in the rose garden! 

The large purple egg in her hand pulses as if it were breathing. As if it were 
getting ready to burst from the shell! 


Turn to PAGE 58.

You have a funny feeling no one would believe you if you said you have 
twin grandmas and one’s in trouble on the train. 

You’re not even sure if you believe you! 

You decide to investigate on your own. 

You continue through the moving train. You arrive at the compartment with 
the message in the window. It’s smeared, but traces of the red letters are still 
there. 

You aren’t crazy, after all. 

You search the seat for clues. A lost wallet. Or luggage. Anything to prove 
the woman’s identity. 

But you find nothing. 

You get to the door at the far end of the car and reach for the handle. 

A heavy hand lands on your shoulder. 

“Where do you think you’re going?” a gruff voice demands. 


Uh-oh. Who has you in such a strong grip? Quick! Flip to PAGE 89 . 




81 


The alien bends over, opens its mouth, and vomits out a slimy, snarling, dog¬ 
like monster. 

“Meet Fido,” the yellow-eyed creature says with a laugh. 

Fido snarls. It has three rows of razor-sharp teeth. Its fangs drip with slime. 

“I can’t tell you anything! I don’t know what you’re talking about!” you 
gasp. 

“Perhaps your friends will be more cooperative.” The two other aliens each 
vomit out a drooling dog. 

Fido lunges at you. The other monster-dogs leap at Chuck and Ginny. 

“It’s hurting me!” Chuck screams. “Tell them!” 

You desperately push the monster-dog away. You’re almost too terrified to 
think. Should you just tell them your address? You know your grandmother isn’t 
this evil Mithra-Dithra, so what difference would it make? 

But once you give the creatures what they want, won’t they go ahead and 
kill you? They won’t need you anymore. 

Decide quick! Fido’s drool burns your skin like acid!

“In here!” you hiss. You, Andrew, and Sophie pile into the closet. You yank 
the door shut behind you just as the bedroom door bursts open. 

You can hear Grandma bustling about in the room. 

Please don’t look in the closet, you think over and over. Please don’t look in 
the closet! 

Sophie has her hand over her mouth. Andrew’s eyes are shut. 

After a few tense moments, you hear the door open and close again. You 
glance at Sophie and Andrew. Sophie shrugs. Andrew opens his eyes and nods. 

You take a deep breath and open the door.

The conductor-creature snaps open a wall panel, revealing dials, knobs, and 
switches. Your grandma is still frozen in the force field. The conductor turns a 
dial. 

The train car suddenly hums with a pulsing electronic sound. With a 
mmbling WHOOSH the baggage car releases from the train. It shoots in the 
opposite direction down the track. 

“What’s going on?” Chuck yells over the noise. 

Before you can answer, the car lurches. You’re thrown to the floor. In an 
instant, the baggage car lifts off the ground and hurtles into the sky. 

“We’re in some kind of spaceship!” you cry. 

“Now that you realize there is no escape,” the ex-conductor suggests, 
“perhaps you will be more cooperative.” 

“Tell us.” The smaller alien approaches you slowly. “Where do you live? 
Where did your grandmother bury the eggs?” 

“I don’t know what you’re talking about!” you protest. 

“You’ll change your story,” the other creature warns. “We’ll get the answer 
we want.” 

Then it does something so disgusting, you nearly faint. 


What’s so disgusting? Turn to PAGE 81 . If you can stand it! 



84 

Stop being ridiculous, you scold yourself. What’s the big deal about a silver 
jumpsuit? Your own mother wears mismatched socks and goofy hats. 

“Come on,” you tell Andrew and Sophie. “I’ll introduce you.” 

The three of you stroll across the backyard to the rose garden. The flowers 
are unusually large, and have a strong odor. Almost sickeningly sweet. 

“I’ve never seen roses that color before,” Andrew says. 

Come to think of it, neither have you. Blue roses? Striped roses? This is one 
weird rose garden. 

Grandma stands as she sees you approaching. “Oh, goody,” she gushes. “I 
enjoy meeting new people.” 

“Cool flowers,” Sophie compliments Grandma. 

“Thank you, dear,” Grandma says. “Why don’t you take a closer look?” 

You, Sophie, and Andrew wander into the thicket of rose bushes. Some of 
them are so large, they tower over you. You gaze at a bright-green rose. 

Whoa! 

Is that a pair of eyes staring back at you? 


Gasp and turn to PAGE 103 .

You have to find out what makes the suitcases weigh so much. 

Then you have to find out how Grandma carried them so easily! 

“Okay,” you whisper to the cab driver. “But hurry!” 

You glance around. No Grandma. Great! You figure she’s still checking out 
her precious rose bushes. 

The cab driver fiddles with the lock on the luggage. “Hmm,” he murmurs. 
“I’ve never seen a lock like this before.” 

You bend down beside him. You examine the small lock on the suitcase. It 
glows blue and feels warm in your hand. It’s not a combination lock, and it 
doesn’t seem to have a slot for a key. “It is weird,” you agree. 

“Now I really want to get these bags open!” The cab driver laughs. “I can’t 
resist a challenge!” 

You peer closely at the lock. You notice a small rose etched into the metal. 

“I wonder if ...” 

You press hard on the rose. 

The lock snaps open!

“Cookie! Cookie, over here!” 

You shudder at hearing your old nickname. You hate that name! Luckily, 
Ginny and Chuck aren’t around to hear it! 

“Cookie!” 

You turn toward the voice. At the end of the station you see a woman with 
white hair. She’s waving wildly. No way to mistake her for anyone else. Not in 
those clothes. 

You wave back, approaching her cautiously. Anyone who would call you 
“Cookie” is likely to pinch your cheeks, too. 

As you stroll down the platform, something catches your eye. Bright red 
letters scrawled across one of the train windows. 

A message! 

If your mother hadn’t made that strange phone call, you wouldn’t have 
thought twice about it. But now you have an odd feeling.... 

Maybe the message is meant for you. 


Read the message on PAGE 100 . 




87 


“Those guys aren’t human,” you tell Ginny and Chuck. You shudder. “I 
don’t want to try taking them on.” 

You, Chuck, and Ginny scrunch down as low as you can behind the trunks. 
You try to not even breathe. 

Then you hear the door slide open again. 

Have they left? you wonder. Or did someone else come in? 

Only one way to find out. 

You crawl between packing crates and boxes, searching for signs of the 
creatures. As you slide along the floor, something hooks around your ankle. 

CRASH! A large, rectangular mirror wrapped in plastic thuds to the floor 
right behind you. 

Oh, no! Did those yellow-eyed creatures hear you? Are you about to be 
zapped? 


Hold your breath until PAGE 68 .

“We have to stop them now,” you whisper. “By the time we go for help, they 
could be anywhere!” 

“Doing anything!” Andrew adds with a shudder. 

But how can you stop them? you wonder. You watch the horrifying 
creatures, trying to think of an idea. 

“Feed well,” Grandma orders. “And then we must begin.” 

The slimy aliens swarm over the roses, munching everything in their path. 
Grandma strolls through the wriggling masses. You remember how she told them 
to feed and grow. You don’t have much time. Whatever you do, it has to be fast 
and effective. 

“Let’s squash them!” you decide. “While they’re all in the garden.” 

“Brilliant,” Sophie replies. “How?” 


Figure out an answer on PAGE 13 .

You wriggle out of the hand’s grasp and spin around. 
The train conductor glares down at you. 

Strange, you think. He’s wearing dark glasses. 

But what he says isn’t strange at all. 

“Ticket, please.” 

Oops. You forgot about needing a ticket. 

Now what?

You tear across the linoleum ... 

And smash right into your mom! 

She shrieks and drops a plate of scrambled eggs. Your dad jumps up from 
the table, scattering his newspaper. 

“Mom! Dad! What are you doing here?” you demand. 

“I got an emergency call from work,” Mom explains, cleaning up the mess. 
“That’s what I told you on the phone at the train station, remember? So we cut 
our trip short. We just got in half an hour ago. We didn’t want to wake you. 
Where’s Grandma?” 

You sneak a peek at Sophie and Andrew. “Uh—I guess she’s still sleeping,” 
you mumble. 

Well, it might be true. Even if she is sleeping in the garage. 

“Sit down, kids,” your mom commands. “I made a huge breakfast.” 

Excellent! You, Sophie, and Andrew wolf down three big plates of 
scrambled eggs. Even your dad, who usually only has coffee in the morning, 
manages to finish a second helping. 

“Funny,” he says. “I can’t stop eating these eggs.” 

You suddenly have trouble swallowing.

Grandma gazes solemnly at you. “I’m a secret agent,” she informs you. 

Your mouth drops open. “Y-y-you ... what?” you sputter. 

“It’s true. Those men who grabbed me think I’m smuggling a special 
computer disk.” 

“Are you?” you blurt. 

She smiles. “It’s better if you don’t know for sure.” 

You have a zillion questions you want to ask her. But a sharp knock on the 
bathroom door startles you. Grandma pulls a small, high-tech device from her 
pocket. 

“What do you think we should do?” she whispers. “Should we take our 
chances and open the door? Or should we sneak out through the window?” 

It’s up to you.

“I’m not really a passenger on the train,” you tell the conductor. 

“Could have fooled me,” the conductor responds. 

“I mean, that is, uh ...” You’re having trouble explaining. 

“Yes? This I have to hear.” The conductor crosses his arms and peers down 
at you. 

“I saw this fight. A woman struggling with two guys in sunglasses. And I 
think the woman was my grandma.” 

“Your grandma? In a brawl?” The conductor snorts in disbelief. 

“But it’s true!” you cry. 

It’s no use. He grabs your sleeve and yanks you to the door. 

“That’s the worst excuse for not paying a fare that I ever heard!” he declares. 
He lifts you up under the armpits and lowers you to the platform. 

Luckily, the train hasn’t picked up much speed yet. You only stumble a few 
steps. 

“Cookie!” Your furious grandmother marches toward you. “What’s gotten 
into you? Jumping on and off moving trains! That’s it. You’re grounded!” 

Some way to start a vacation. Grounded! You can’t wait until your 
grandmother’s visit comes to an 


END. 



93 


Sophie, Andrew, Andrew’s parents — they’re all aliens. You’re the only 
human in the room! 

You’re too horrified to think of running. 

Andrew reaches into his pocket and pulls out a squirming baby alien. He 
places it on your shoulder. “Feed and grow,” he tells it. 

Uh-oh. 

As the baby alien nibbles at your ear, you think: Mom wouldn’t let me get 
my ear pierced, but I got my way in the — OWWWWWWWW! 

THE END! 


94 

“I don’t want to face those creatures alone!” you say. “Let’s go get help!” 

The three of you half-crawl, half-stumble out of the backyard. The moment 
you reach the street, you take off running. You cover the three blocks to 
Andrew’s house in record time. 

“Mom! Dad!” Andrew yells as you charge through the front door. “Come 
quick!” 

Andrew’s parents step into the hallway from the dining room. “What’s all 
the shouting?” his dad asks. 

“Aliens!” you blurt. “There are aliens in my backyard!” 

Andrew’s parents stare at you. Then they start to laugh. 

Oh, no! They don’t believe you! 


Convince them on PAGE 102.

“Grandma! Look out!” You race toward her. 

But Grandma doesn’t need any help! She leaps to her feet and assumes a 
karate stance. With a swift kick, she knocks one creature to the ground. It’s out 
cold. 

The other creature jumps her from behind. Grandma bends sharply at the 
waist and flips the creature over her back. It falls in a crumpled heap. 

With a howl, the conductor-creature reaches for Grandma. But she’s ready 
for it. She ducks, then grabs one of its tentacles. She jerks the creature hard and 
it tumbles over. In a smooth move, she uses the tentacles to tie all three creatures 
together. 

Your mouth drops open in awe. 

“Whoa!” You let out a long, low whistle. “Some action!” 

“That was awesome!” Ginny agrees. 

“Totally!” adds Chuck. 

Grandma beams at you. She rubs her hands together. “That was fun!” she 
exclaims. 

You stare at her. 

Is this amazing woman really your grandmother? 


Turn to PAGE 119.

You glance around, hoping for an idea. Your eyes land on a ladder leading to 
the top of the train. 

“Up there!” You grab a rung and climb. At the top, you reach down and help 
lug up Grandma. Your muscles strain with the effort. Chuck and Ginny shove 
her from below as you yank her limp arms. Finally, you’re all gasping on top of 
the train. 

“We don’t know how long that force field will hold,” you warn. “We better 
keep moving.” 

The three of you drag Grandma across the car-tops. It’s tough going. You’re 
not sure if this was such a good idea. 

“I’ll see if anyone is looking for us.” You scurry to the side of the train. 
“Grab my ankles.” 

Ginny and Chuck grasp your ankles and lower you down headfirst. You peer 
into the train car window. 

And gasp! 

The train car is filled with people in sunglasses. 

One of them notices you. He points and moves closer to the window. He 
pulls off his glasses to take a better look. 

Yellow Ping-Pong-ball eyes! 


Panic all the way to PAGE 111 .

“Out the window,” you declare. “Or we’ll be trapped in here.” 

“Good choice,” Grandma says. She slips the device back into her pocket. 
You peer out the window. The countryside speeds by. 

There’s nowhere to go out that window, you realize. Nowhere but down. 

The pounding on the door increases. It strains on its hinges. No more time to 
waste. 

“Remember—duck and roll,” Grandma instructs you. She gives you a boost 
up. 

Then you fling yourself out the window. 


Duck and roll to PAGE 61. 



98 

You gaze at the startling scene through the window. Inside the train 
compartment a woman struggles fiercely with two men. The men wear tan 
overcoats and large, dark sunglasses. 

But it’s the woman who holds your attention. 

A white-haired woman wearing yellow stretch pants and a purple shirt. 

She’s a dead ringer for your grandma! 

The two thug-like men yank her under each arm and lift her out of the seat. 
Her terrified eyes lock onto yours as she is dragged roughly into the aisle. The 
men pull her toward the door at the far end of the car. 


Hurry to PAGE 54 .

Ginny’s and Chuck’s screams rip through you worse than the monster-dog’s 
acid drool. 

“Okay! Okay!” you shriek. “Call off the dogs!” 

You rattle off your address. 

“Very good.” The three alien creatures lean over and open their jaws wide. 
The monster-dogs jump back into their mouths. The creatures swallow. 

Then all three belch and pat their tummies. 

Man. Talk about disgusting. 

“We are terribly sorry,” the ex-conductor says. “But we really did need to 
know. And now we’ll take you home.” 

With the twist of a few dials, the spaceship changes direction. In minutes 
you land behind your house. 

You glance out the window and gasp. 

What has you so upset? 


Rush to PAGE 104.

You gaze at the train window. You read the red letters aloud. 

“EMPLEH. EMPLEH,” you mutter. What does it mean? It doesn’t sound 
familiar. Maybe it’s not an English word. 

That terrible nickname interrupts your thoughts. 

“Cookie! I’m waiting for a big hug and kiss!” 

Exactly what you were afraid of. 

“Hi, Grandma.” You stop several inches away from her. Just beyond her 
reach. 

Wrong! Grandma throws her arms around you, squeezing you hard. So hard, 
you can barely breathe. Finally, she releases you. 

“Cabs are at the other end of the station,” you gasp, trying to catch your 
breath. 

Grandma follows behind you, chattering all the way. She asks about your 
school, your parents, and your mother’s rose bushes. 

On the way out of the station, you pass the train window with the message 
again. 

I’ve got it! you think. I know what it means! 

Do you really? 


If you know what it says, turn to PAGE 14 .

“What’s the problem?” you ask the struggling cab driver. “Skipped breakfast 
this morning?” 

The cab driver glares at you. Sweat trickles down his forehead. “You try to 
lift those bags,” he grunts. 

You reach in and grab the handle of the top suitcase. 

Whoa! That bag is heavy! You grit your teeth and yank hard. Every muscle 
strains as you lift the bag out of the trunk. 

“I don’t get it,” you murmur. “Grandma carried both of those bags without 
any trouble.” 

“Then Grandma must be a weight lifter,” the cab driver snaps. 

Together, you half-drag, half-carry the luggage to the front door. You drop 
yours with a loud thud. “That must weigh two hundred pounds,” you gasp. 

The cab driver glances around. “Let’s open them,” he whispers. “I want to 
know what Grandma has that weighs so much!” 

Hmm. You know it would be snooping. But you’re dying of curiosity. 

What are you going to do? 


Open the suitcases on PAGE 85 . 

Tell the cab driver “No way” on PAGE 7 . 





102 


“Come see!” you shriek. “There are dozens of them in my backyard! 
Andrew, tell them!” 

But he doesn’t say a word! 

You turn to Sophie. “Sophie! You saw them! Tell them I’m not crazy.” 

You don’t like the way they’re all smiling at you. As if they were all in on a 
big joke. 

“There are aliens trying to take over the world!” you shout. “Why won’t you 
believe me?” 

“We do believe you,” Andrew’s mother says in a soothing tone. 

Then she peels off her face! 

So do Andrew, Sophie, and Andrew’s dad. 

They look exactly like Grandma! 


This is bad. Turn to PAGE 93 to see if there’s a way out. 




103 


The eyes on the rose blink at you! 

“Sophie! Andrew!” you choke out. “Run!” 

But your warning comes too late. Long green tendrils wrap themselves 
around you and your friends. 

“Noooo!” Sophie shrieks. 

“What’s happening?” Andrew screams. 

You strain against the tight grip of the plant. “Grandma! Help us!” you cry. 
But Grandma ignores you. She skips through the rose bushes, chanting. 
You’re about to holler again when the rose spits a glob of slimy orange goo right 
into your face. It fills your mouth and eyes. 

You wipe your face on your sleeve, but the sticky substance won’t come off. 
It’s too thick. You can’t see a thing. 

But you can hear Sophie and Andrew screaming for help. And Grandma 
reciting something. It sounds like a nursery rhyme! 

You struggle to move toward your friends, but your feet are stuck. Is the 
plant wrapped around them? you wonder. 

Then you realize the horrible truth. You no longer have feet. You have roots. 
You’re turning into a plant! 


Turn to PAGE 113. 




104 


“Oh, no!” you wail. “You landed on my mom’s petunias. They’re totally 
mined. My mom’s going to go ballistic!” 

But it gets worse. As soon as the spaceship hatch pops open, the creatures go 
to work. They dig up her prize rose bushes. 

You are going to be in big trouble when your mom comes home. 

You don’t believe what you see next. You are soon ankle-deep in hundreds 
of enormous, pulsing purple eggs. 

Your grandma must be an alien after all! 

When the creatures have filled their ship with the eggs, the ex-conductor 
approaches you. “Now you understand why we must keep your grandmother. 

But we apologize for the mess,” it says. “Here are some seeds to replace the 
plants we destroyed.” 

“Uh, thanks.” You take the packet from the wiggling tentacle. 

With a wave, the creature enters the spaceship. You watch it leave the 
atmosphere. 

Chuck and Ginny help you with the garden. Alien flowers grow differently 
from Earth plants, you realize. Within minutes the garden is overflowing with 
gigantic roses. 

Your mom should be pleased. As long as she doesn’t mind roses that smell 
like bananas and glow in the dark! 


THE END 



105 


The moment the lock pops open, the suitcase begins to vibrate. 

You stumble backward, banging into the startled cab driver. He trips and the 
two of you tumble off the front step. You land hard on the lawn. 

The suitcase spins around and around. As it bounces wildly, the sides slowly 
open. Purple mist escapes from the bag with a hissing sound. 

“Wh-wh-what’s going on?” the cab driver stammers. 

But you can’t answer him. You are too stunned by what you are seeing. With 
a WHOOSH! a giant rose bush bursts from Grandma’s suitcase! 

You scramble to your feet. The terrified cab driver is still sprawled on the 
ground directly below the huge rose bush. Grandma races around the corner of 
the house. 

“Oh!” she calls. “I see you’ve found my prize plant.” 

You stare up at the dozens of giant flowers towering over you. Each bud is 
twice the size of your head. “But what—? How—?” 

Grandma smiles. A strange, evil smile. 

“How did it get so big?” she finishes for you. “My rose has a very special 
diet. And I think it’s time for lunch!”

106 


“This way!” You dash to the window, Andrew and Sophie right behind you. 
You yank it open and stick your head out. 

The ground suddenly seems very faraway. 

However, Grandma’s footsteps are definitely very close! 

“Try to land in the rose garden,” you instruct your friends. “The bushes 
should help cushion the fall.” 

You climb out onto the window ledge. You shut your eyes, and take a deep 
breath. 

Then you jump. 

You land on a tall rose bush. Thorns poke you all over. You feel shaken up, 
but you aren’t hurt. Andrew and Sophie leap down beside you. 

You pull yourself out of the scratchy branches and plop onto the soft ground. 
You gaze up at the window. 

Grandma smiles down at you. 

A chilling, evil smile. 

Then she vanishes back inside.

107 


These creeps think you’re related to a powerful alien. Maybe if you act 
powerful, too, they’ll be afraid of you. 

“Call off your dogs!” you command. You try to sound like alien royalty. “Or 
I’ll unleash my own forces.” 

The creatures glance at each other. One of them makes a shrill beeping 
sound. The vomit-dogs freeze in mid-bite. 

Hah! This might work. 

“Now that you have seen through my human disguise,” you continue, 
“there’s no point in pretending. I am Smithra-Schmithra—heir to the Mithra- 
Dithra kingdom.” 

Ginny and Chuck stare at you. This is fun! 

“So stay back!” you bellow. “Or you’ll feel my wrath!” You point at the 
three creatures. 

Sparks shoot out of your fingers! 

Huh? How’d you do that? 


Turn to PAGE 116. 




108 


A chill runs through you. What was your mother trying to say? Is your 
grandmother in trouble? Is there danger at the station? 

As you hand the phone back to the information clerk, the whole train station 
begins to rumble. 

Could this be what your mother was trying to warn you about? 

Should you get out of there and go home? 

Or are you supposed to find your grandmother? 


If you get out of there right away, turn to PAGE 12 . 
If you stay to find Grandma, turn to PAGE 33 . 





109 


“Mom?” you ask. “Where did you get the eggs?” 

You aren’t happy when you hear the answer. 

“From the refrigerator, silly,” she tells you. She scoops up another forkful. 
“Did you buy them? They weren’t there when we left.” 

You gaze at Sophie, then at Andrew. Then you stare down at your plate of 
food. 

“Were they, uh, kind of unusual-looking?” you ask your mom. 

“Come to think of it, they were rather large.” She thinks for a moment. “And 
a strange color.” 

Your stomach does a flip-flop. 

You’ve been eating the alien eggs! 

Have you ever heard the expression, “You are what you eat”? 

You’re about to find out how true it really is! 


THE END 



110 


You have to find out if that woman in trouble is your grandmother. Besides, 
you’re dying to find out why those men in dark glasses were fighting with a little 
old lady—and having such a hard time! 

The train starts to pull out of the station. You race down the platform, 
searching for a good spot to jump aboard. Your legs and arms pump hard, your 
muscles straining, as you match the speed of the train. 

“COOKIE! Come back here! What are you doing?” Grandma’s voice floats 
after you. 

If I’m wrong, you think, and the woman on the train isn’t my real grandma, 
I’m going to be in big trouble. 

But you’re not going to back out now. 

You take a deep breath and leap! 

Will you make it? 


Land on PAGE 64. 




111  


“Pull me up! Pull me up!” you shriek. Ginny and Chuck lift you back on top 
of the train. 

“They saw me! They know we’re up here!” you yell. “They’ll be after us 
any second!” 

Ginny and Chuck stare at each other. Their faces are white with fear. Yours 
is, too. 

“We’re going to have a hard time escaping with your grandmother like that.” 
Chuck points to Grandma. She looks like a limp rag doll. 

“We can’t waste any time,” you urge. You peek over the side of the train 
again. 

And stare into a pair of yellow eyes gazing up at you. 

One of the creatures is leaning out the window. 

Do something! Fast!

Grandma yanks the mp3 player out of Sophie’s hands. She throws it to the 
ground. Andrew runs and trips, smashing the CD player. You’re so scared, you 
drop the radio. 

Silence. 

Aliens swarm around you. Their teeth dig into your ankles. 

Think of something! Try anything! 

Maybe it wasn’t sound waves that killed the creatures, you realize. Maybe it 
was music! 

You sing the first words that pop into your head. “Happy birthday to you,” 
you warble. 

“Nooo!” Grandma shrieks again. 

The aliens gnawing on your ankles fall over. Andrew and Sophie figure out 
what you’re doing. They begin singing, too. 

After five choruses of “Happy Birthday,” the garden is filled with dead 
aliens. You defeated them all. Even Grandma. 

You, Sophie, and Andrew collapse to the ground. 

“We did it!” you exclaim. “We stopped the alien invasion!” 

“Now what do we do?” Sophie asks. “Do we tell someone?” 

Abroad grin spreads across your face. “I think we should form a singing 
group.” 

“What?” Andrew stares at you. “A singing group?” 

“You bet,” you reply. “We’d knock ’em dead!” 


THE END 



113 


Panic rises in your chest, making it difficult for you to breathe. 

“Grandma! Help!” you pant. 

But it’s no use. She continues to chant. 

Your face twists. Your skin flakes, forming petals. Your arms flatten against 
your sides. Your body gets longer and thinner. 

The whole time, Grandma goes on chanting. A chill runs through your 
mutated body. You finally realize what she’s reciting. 

It’s a nursery rhyme, all right. But with some major changes in the words: 

“Roses are red 

Violets are blue 

What you didn’t know was ... 

The rose would be YOU!” 


THE END 



114 


“Sophie!” You stare at your friend. 

She grins. “Just kidding. About the torture part. But I do think we should 
capture your grandma.” 

A horrible thought hits you. “Oh, no!” you gasp. “If the woman in the garden 
is an alien, then the woman I saw at the train station must be my real 
grandmother!” 

What should you do? Your real grandma is in danger. But you and your 
friends are in danger too! Maybe the whole world is in danger from the alien. 

You don’t know why she’s here!

“We better do something about the eggs,” you decide. “I think Grandma will 
stay put for a while.” 

You, Sophie, and Andrew approach the rose garden. Dozens of large purple 
eggs lie scattered on the ground. They’re not pulsing or glowing anymore. 

“What do you think they are?” Sophie whispers. 

“I don’t know,” you admit. “They could be alien food. Or alien flower bulbs 

“Or little alien monsters waiting to hatch,” Andrew adds. 

You glare at him. “Thanks for pointing that out.” You gaze back at the rows 
of roses, wondering what to do. 

And you can’t help noticing that it’s getting dark. 

“What if we stick them in the fridge?” Andrew tugs at his messy hair. “It 
would be too cold for them to hatch, and we can have them analyzed at a lab 
tomorrow.” 

“Or maybe we should squash them.” You know it sounds harsh, but it might 
be the safest thing to do. 


Which is it going to be? Squash the eggs on PAGE 126 . 
Refrigerate them on PAGE 56 . 





116 


The sparks from your fingers short-circuit the orange force field around your 
grandmother. 

Grandma shakes her head a few times. Then she smiles at you. 

“Cookie!” she exclaims. “Good. I see you have everything under control. I 
knew I could count on you.” 

You wave your hand at the cowering yellow-eyed creatures again. Sparks fly 
at them. “Wh-wh-what’s going on?” you stammer. 

Grandma beams. “Awww,” she coos. “My little baby is growing up. You’ve 
reached the age when you can use your powers.” 

Powers? So it’s true? 

You are an alien after all! 

Your grandma is Mithra-Dithra. Together, you take over the world. 

You put Ginny and Chuck in charge of their very own solar systems. And 
you make the yellow-eyed thugs your galactic chauffeurs. 


THE END 



117 


“Yes,” Grandma croons. “I think my baby is hungry.” 

You gaze up at the huge rose bush. Could it be? Is it ... moving? 

Your heart pounds triple time. One of the enormous roses bends down 
toward the cab driver. In a flash, it gobbles him up. You shut your eyes. But you 
can still hear the cab driver’s muffled screams. 

Then — silence. 

Trembling, you open your eyes. 

Oh, no! The gigantic flower is inches from your head! 

“Good, baby,” Grandma coos. “You ate every bite of dinner. So now you get 
to have a nice treat for dessert!” 

Eek! 

You have a terrible feeling you know what dessert is going to be! 

Well, what did you expect with a nickname like Cookie ? 


THE END 



118 


You reach toward the box of hands. Your stomach lurches, but you have to 
find out if they’re real. 

Your fingers gently poke at the flesh. 

Rubber! 

You let out a huge sigh. “They’re fake!” you exclaim. 

“That doesn’t explain why they’re here,” Sophie points out. 

Andrew searches the closet over by the window. “There are feet in this 
closet,” he tells you. 

Before you can go over to look, you hear footsteps on the stairs. 

Grandma! 

“Quick! We have to get out of here!” you whisper hoarsely. The footsteps 
are coming closer. 

“If we leave now,” Sophie says, “she’ll see us!” 

Sophie is right. 

Your eyes desperately scan the room for a place to hide. Or a way out. Your 
gaze lands on the window. 

Do you dare? 

Or should you pop into the closet?

“What a mess!” Grandma glances around the wrecked baggage car. “Help 
me find my suitcases. Then we can get out of here.” 

You spot a suitcase with your grandmother’s name on it. The top is popped 
open. Papers slide out of it onto the floor. 

“Found one!” you call. As you place the papers back into the suitcase, 
several files catch your eye. 

top secret! confidential! special government documents! are stamped 
all over the files. 

Grandma darts over and snatches the files out of your hands. 

“Thanks,” she says. She shoves the papers into the suitcase and snaps the lid 
shut. 

You stare at her. What is your grandmother doing with secret government 
files? 

You’re about to ask her when the door flies open again. 

“Thank goodness I found you before it’s too late!” a voice cries. 

It’s the other Grandma! 


Face the twin Grandmas on PAGE 55. 




120 


“Run along now,” Grandma tells you. 

You bound out of her room, downstairs, and out the back door. You hate to 
admit it, but your own grandmother gives you the creeps. You can’t shake the 
feeling that something is very wrong. 

Sophie and Andrew are sprawled on your back porch. 

“Hey, guys,” you greet them. “What’s up?” 

“We’re hungry!” Sophie announces. “We need brownies.” 

Andrew nods. “Or we’ll collapse before the big event.” 

“What big event?” you ask, leading them into the kitchen. You set a plate of 
Mom’s fresh brownies on the table. 

Sophie and Andrew are too busy munching to answer. Finally, Sophie 
swallows. “Milk,” she croaks. “Give me milk!” 

You grab the milk carton. You hold it over Sophie’s head. “Tell me what the 
big event is,” you insist. “Or I’ll give you a milk shampoo!” 

Andrew snorts. “How about a milky way shampoo?” He holds up a 
newspaper. “Check this out.” 

You grab the newspaper and scan the article. “Meteor shower tonight,” you 
read aloud. “Cool!” 

You peer at the tiny map. Then your eyes widen. “Hey! That’s my house!” 
you sputter. “Fifteen years ago, a meteor crashed here. Right in our rose garden!” 


Turn to PAGE 65. 




121 


“Jump,” Grandma whispers down to you. “These aren’t the good guys.” 

The helicopter is already lifting away. You glance at the ground below you. 
Yikes! 

“Grab the disk out of my sock,” Grandma continues. “Don’t let them see you 
do it. Take it straight to the address on the label. You’ll be safe there.” 

She has the special disk on her after all! Cool! 

You slip the disk out of her sock. Grandma climbs up as if nothing is wrong. 
You take a deep breath and let go of the ladder. 

After jumping from a moving train, this doesn’t seem so bad. You land and 
take off running. 

All this fuss over some stupid computer program! You dart into some bushes 
and examine the disk. The address on the label isn’t too far from your house. 

You head off in the right direction. 


Turn to PAGE 123. 




122 


“Hold it!” the reporter yelps. “No way am I going to miss the story of the 
century!” 

“Shut up!” you shout. You notice Andrew and Sophie hanging back in the 
doorway. Their eyes are wide open, staring at you. “It’s a lie!” you wail at them. 

“Cookie! How can you say that? Of course it’s true.” Grandma holds out her 
seven arms to hug you. 

“This is great stuff!” the reporter cheers. “Child discovers alien identity. 
Alien confesses all! I see a promotion for me!” 

At least somebody’s happy here, you think. 

Cheer up! Seven arms could come in handy. And maybe, if Grandma’s 
movie is a big hit, she’ll let you be her manager. 


THE END 



123 


You sneak back toward home. You try to stay out of sight. 

By the time you pass your house, you’re pretty sure you’re safe. You check 
the address on the computer disk again. You wonder what’s on the disk. What 
makes it so valuable? 

You can’t resist. You dash into your house. In your room, you switch on your 
computer and slip it into the drive. 

Your eyes widen. “Awesome! Totally, completely, amazingly awesome!” 

You can’t take your eyes off the screen. 

All the next year’s computer games are on this disk. You scroll through the 
files. Every major company! 

You can play them all before anyone else! 

You click open a file. Whoa — neat! Nuclear Ninja added new music! You 
open another. Destroyer added four new levels! This is fantastic. You could sit 
here for hours! 

BANG! CRASH! WHAM! 

You’re so startled you fall off your desk chair. When you glance up, you 
discover a thug in an overcoat and sunglasses standing in your doorway. Your 
broken-down doorway. And there’s another leaning in your window. Your 
smashed window. 

Uh-oh. Guess what? 

It’s GAME OVER for you! 


THE END 



124 


Suddenly, your flashlights blink out. 

“Oh, no!” you gasp. “What’s wrong with the flashlights?” 

“Look at the sky!” Sophie yells. 

You glance up. Your mouth drops open in awe. 

The sky is lit up with shooting stars. Hundreds of specks of light dance in the 
blackness. The night becomes almost as bright as day. 

“There must be hundreds of them,” Andrew murmurs. 

You gaze at the dazzling sight. “It’s beautiful,” you say. Then you glance 
over at the rose garden. You begin to tremble. 

The eggs are completely visible in the brilliant light of the meteor shower. 
They bounce around on the ground. You hear a low rumbling sound, like a 
refrigerator humming. 

It’s coming from the eggs. 

“I think they’re about to hatch!” you shout. 


Turn to PAGE 131. 




125 


To quote Andrew, “Are you nuts?” 

You must not read these books very often. 

Otherwise you would know better. 

Do you actually think that Grandma will tell you why she has boxes of hands 
and feet? Why she has a mask that could pass for your mom? What the deal is 
with the rose garden and the meteors? 

Okay, maybe she will tell you. 

But then what will she do? 

Chances are, it won’t be pretty. 


Very, very quickly and very, very quietly turn back to PAGE 127 . And 
make a different choice. 




126 


“You’re probably right,” Sophie says. “We should destroy the eggs.” 

“Yeah,” Andrew agrees. “Better safe than sorry, I guess.” 

“Do you think stepping on them will work?” Sophie asks. “They look 
awfully big and sturdy.” 

“One way to find out,” you tell her. You stride toward one of the eggs. You 
lift up your foot and bring it down hard. 

KA-BOOM!!!!!!!!! 

Whoops. 

Guess you didn’t notice the little purple land mines mixed in with the purple 
alien eggs. Grandma placed them in the garden to protect her babies. 

Oh, well. Better luck next mine.... 


THE END 




127 


All clear! 

Sophie pulls out one of the shoe boxes from the closet. “She’s got other stuff 
in here, too,” she informs you. She holds up a wig. Andrew reaches in and pulls 
out a mask. 

It looks exactly like your mother! 

You feel your own very real face go pale. “Why would Grandma have 
something like that?” you ask. 

“Hey, look at this!” Sophie holds up a pile of newspaper clippings. “They’re 
all about the meteor shower tonight.” 

“I don’t get it!” you wail. “None of this makes any sense. Why would 
Grandma have these things? Why is she obsessed with the rose garden? And 
those clippings! What is up with all this?” 

“I think you should go ask her,” Sophie suggests. 

“Are you nuts?” Andrew scoffs. “We should wait until the meteor shower 
and see if she does something.”

“Quick!” you shriek. “Lift!” 

You, Chuck, and Ginny hoist the heavy mirror over your heads. It pierces the 
orange beam. The rays bend and bounce off the mirror—straight at the two 
thugs. 

The two creatures stand frozen in place. 

“It’s working!” you cry. “Grab Grandma!” 

You lean the mirror against a luggage rack, aiming the beam directly at the 
creatures. Chuck and Ginny lift Grandma out of the chair. She’s still out cold, 
but at least you’ve rescued her from the force field. 

“Out the back!” you shout. “Hurry!” 

Chuck and Ginny drag Grandma out the back door. You follow right behind 
them. 

Oops. You forgot you were in the last car. 

“So, genius,” Ginny says as she strains to hold up Grandma. “Now what?” 


Turn to PAGE 96.

“Do you know what EMPLEH means?” you ask Grandma. 

“EMPLEH?” she repeats. “No, I’ve never heard that word before. Why do 
you ask?” 

“I saw it written on that train window.” You turn and point back to the train 
car. “I think it’s some kind of message.” 

Grandma grabs your hand and links her arm through yours. “My, my,” she 
coos. “You have such an imagination.” 

Is Grandma walking faster? Or is that your imagination, too? 

“It’s wonderful to see you after so long,” she gushes, hurrying down the 
platform. “And I can’t wait to see your mother’s lovely rose garden.” 

“Yeah, right,” you murmur. You’re still trying to figure out what EMPLEH 
means. 

You snap your fingers. “I know what it means!” you cry.

You gaze down at the garden. You wonder how long it will be before the 
aliens come after you. 

Then you notice something strange. The creatures slither easily out from 
under the objects you’ve thrown down on them. But the aliens near the radio 
shrivel up and fall over! 

“The radio!” you shout. “It destroys them! They must be allergic to sound 
waves or something.” 

“Awesome!” Andrew yells. “We found a weapon!” 

You dash into your room and get your radio. Sophie grabs your mp3 player. 
Andrew snatches an old CD player. You race downstairs and into the garden. 

You aim the radio at a group of creatures. Their slimy skin puckers, turning 
black. They curl up. Little wisps of smoke rise from their crinkly bodies. 

It’s working! 

Sophie and Andrew use the mp3 and CD players in the same way. Little 
aliens are shriveling all around you. 

“Nooo!” a voice bellows. 

Grandma!

“Get ready!” you holler. 

Sophie and Andrew clutch their water guns. You aim yours directly at the 
pulsing, humming egg in front of you. 

The night sky brightens even more. With a roar, the eggs burst open! Bits of 
purple eggshell rain down on you. Creatures crawl out of the eggs. Each one of 
them is different! 

A striped, football-shaped creature scuttles up to you on twelve spidery legs. 
Your finger tightens on the trigger of your water gun.

THE TWISTED TALE OF TIKI ISLAND 


Here’s a sneak peek! 













BEWARE!! 

DO NOT READ THIS 
BOOK FROM 
BEGINNING TO END! 

Yes! You’re psyched for your Tiki Island vacation. Then you go snorkeling 

— and a shark appears, looking for lunch! 

If you hide from the shark in an underwater cave, you’ll find a sunken ship 

— with a real skeleton crew. If you make one wrong move, you could become 
the newest crew member! 

If you fight the shark with a sharp stone from the ocean floor, you learn that 
the stone has evil powers. You’ve got to get rid of it fast. But first you have to 
battle ghostly warriors and brave an active volcano! 

You’re in control of this scary adventure. You decide what will happen. And 
how terrifying the scares will be! 

Start on PAGE 1. Then follow the instructions at the bottom of each page. 
You make the choices. If you choose well, you’ll save Tiki Island from a terrible 
fate. But if you make the wrong choice ... BEWARE! 

SO TAKE A DEEP BREATH. CROSS YOUR FINGERS. AND TURN TO 
PAGE 1 TO GIVE YOURSELF GOOSEBUMPSl 




“Hurry up, Gina,” you call to your cousin. The wooden dock creaks as you 
jump up and down. “The water’s perfect for snorkeling.” 

“I’m coming! I’m coming!” Gina yells. “Yeow! I should have worn sandals. 
The sand is burning my feet.” 

You watch Gina hop across Tiki Island’s famous white sand. Glancing 
around, you remember how much fun you had visiting the island last year. 

Lucky for you, your mom is a travel writer. When she wrote about Tiki 
Island a year ago she brought your whole family. With Gina along this time, you 
know you’re going to have a blast! 

Gina jumps onto the dock to join you. She dumps her snorkeling gear next to 
yours. Then she gazes across the shimmering water. “Wow!” she gasps. “This 
place is amazing!” 

A motorboat hums toward the dock. You’ve arranged for a ride to a nearby 
reef. You grin when you recognize the boy steering. It’s Kala, the resort owner’s 
son. He was your best buddy last year. “Hey, Kala!” you shout with a wave. 

Kala ignores your greeting. And as the boat gets closer, you can see his face 
looks grim.

Kala noses the boat into the dock. He still hasn’t said hello or even smiled at 

you. 

“Kala!” you cry. “Don’t you recognize me?” 

Kala doesn’t answer. 

This is not the boy you remember. Last year he was a total goofball — 
always laughing and pulling pranks. Why is he so unfriendly now? 

“What’s up, Kala?” you ask. “Why are you acting so weird?” 

Kala gazes at you a moment. “A curse has fallen on Tiki Island,” he replies 
slowly. “No one is safe.” 

You stare at him. Then a wide grin spreads across your face. This must be 
one of Kala’s practical jokes! 

“Ignore him,” you whisper to Gina. “He’s just trying to scare us.” 

Gina rolls her eyes. “Whatever,” she says. “Let’s go check out the reef!” 

You grab your snorkeling gear and jump into Kala’s boat. “Oooh, I’m so 
scared of the curse,” you tease him. “But I’ll try to be brave.” 

“Don’t make jokes,” Kala says, frowning. “You may regret it.”

Kala turns his back on you and starts the motor. 

As the boat flies over the crystal-clear water, you try to forget about Kala’s 
odd behavior. Minutes later, you arrive at the reef and Kala cuts the engine. 

“Take care to make wise choices while you are here,” he warns you. “The 
curse of Tiki Island affects these surrounding waters. People have been known to 
... disappear.” 

“Maybe they disappear because you’re so unfriendly!” you grumble. “Come 
on, Gina. The vacation officially begins now!” 

Kala drops anchor. You and Gina put on your diving masks and snorkel 
mouthpieces and jump overboard. Both of you are good swimmers. You head 
toward the farthest point of the reef. 

You glance back at Kala in the boat. His last words worry you. Could there 
really be a curse? You have noticed there are fewer tourists on Tiki Island this 
year. And people at the resort have been acting strangely. You hate to admit it, 
but you feel a little scared. “We should stick together,” you tell Gina. 

“Deal,” she agrees. 

You feel better. 

Sort of.
