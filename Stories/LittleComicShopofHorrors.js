BEWARE!! 

DO NOT READ THIS 
BOOK FROM 
BEGINNING TO END! 

Hey! You never noticed that comic store before. It’s kind of dusty — but 
man, does it have great comics! 

If you check out the books on the spinner rack, you’re spun into a comic¬ 
book universe. Which superhero do you want to be? Will the super-villains 
destroy you? Or worse — will you end up as an ink blot? 

If you follow the horror sign to the basement, look out! You’ll find 
horror down there, all right. But not horror comics ... 

This scary adventure is all about you. You decide what will happen. And 
you decide how terrifying the scares will be! 

Start on PAGE 1. Then follow the instructions at the bottom of each page. 
You make the choices. If you choose well, you’ll make it home again. But if 
you make the wrong choice ... BEWARE! 


SO TAKE A DEEP BREATH. CROSS YOUR FINGERS. AND TURN TO 
PAGE 1 TO GIVE YOURSELF GOOSEBUMPS'.

“I thought after-school clubs were supposed to be fun,” you grumble. You 
love comic books. And a comic club sounded cool. But it’s run by Horace 
Grumbacher, the dullest kid in school! 

How could someone make a subject like comics boring? 

Horace manages. 

He clicks his slide projector to a picture of a comic book cover. “Here’s 
the first issue starring Super-Doer,” he drones. “Today, it’s worth nearly two 
hundred thousand dollars.” 

Click! “And here’s the first appearance of Ballistic Bug. This comic goes 
for nearly twenty thousand.” 

As if any kid in this club can afford that, you think. 

The projector clicks again, and a horror comic appears on the screen. 
Excellent! You love horror! 

But Horace can even make horror dull. “This issue of The Cellar of Scary 
Stories went for sixteen hundred dollars,” he lectures. 

An ugly face sneers at you from the comic cover. Yuck! It looks like a 
rotten pumpkin. With warts. 

You turn away, and notice the classroom clock. How did it get so late? 

You run outside — in time to see a horrible sight. 

“Oh, no!” you groan. 


What’s wrong? Find out on PAGE 2 .

The school bus is already a block away. It left without you! 

“Thanks a lot, Horace,” you growl. Because of his boring lecture, now 
you have to walk home! 

If you follow the same route as the bus, you won’t get home for hours. 

You decide you’d better try a shortcut. Even though it means going through a 
part of town you’ve never seen before. 

You walk and walk along your shortcut. With every step you take, your 
book bag gets heavier. 

The area you’re cutting through looks a little weird. The buildings are all 
old and dingy. The stores huddle together as if they’re holding each other up. 

And the stuff in the windows is very weird. You pass a clothing store that 
seems to be selling Halloween costumes — even though Halloween is months 
away. And those dolls in that toy shop window. They look like ... vampires! 

You’re relieved when you spot a store for vacuum cleaners. That’s normal, 
you think. And next to it... 

Hey! A comic shop! 


Want to visit? Go to PAGE 3.

You step inside. The comic shop is dimly lit. You can barely make out the 
comics on spinning racks. Beyond, in deeper shadows, are tables with row 
after row of boxes. These are the back issues, where collectors look for 
treasures. 

The owner stands behind a cash register. He looks familiar, with his round 
face and warts. But you can’t place him. 

He grunts when he sees you. “Humph. Kids.” 

Well, who does he expect to come in and buy comics? 

As you walk past him, the store owner calls out, “Leave your bag up 
here!” 

You scowl. Why is he treating you like a thief? You think about leaving. 
But you’d like a rest from walking. And besides, you really want to check out 
the comics. 

Strolling around the racks, you notice the latest issue of Major Disaster. 
You bought it just a week ago. This guy has a sticker on it for half price! 

Walking a little faster, you start picking up comic books. Doesn’t the 
owner know what these things are worth? 

The deeper into the store you go, the darker it gets. A pair of bookcases 
block your way. But there’s a little space between them. You see light coming 
through the crack.... 


Push through to PAGE 4 . 




4 

You squeeze between the bookcases into an open area. A dusty lightbulb 
dangles from the ceiling. In its dim glow, you make out another spinning rack 
full of comics. 

A sign taped to the top of the rack says: 

YOU THINK THIS IS A LIBRARY? 

LOOK, BUT DON’T TOUCH ... OR YOU’LL BE SORRY. 

You peer at the comics on the rack. Whoa — that’s the issue of Ballistic 
Bug from Horace’s slide show! The comic is marked for two bucks! And up 
there, on the top rack — is that the incredibly expensive copy of Super-Doer? 

Then you notice something else. A doorway. Beyond the rack. Metal 
stairs lead downward — to the basement, you guess. An arrow-shaped sign 
points down the stairway. It reads: horror. 

There’s also a tattered sign on the open door. You try to make out the 
faded letters. It seems to say no admittance, trespassers will be GLOMPFed. 

GLOMPFed? What’s that? 

You don’t really care. All you care about is making a tough decision: 
Should you take a closer look at the rack, or should you go down to the horror 
section? 


If you check out the rack, turn to PAGE 12 . 
If you go downstairs, turn to PAGE 51 .

A way out? 

“Count me in!” you shout. Your heart starts to thump in your chest. There 
might be a way out of this maze of horrors! 

Then you start to wonder. Why is Russell treating it like a deep, dark 
secret? 

Russell sees the look on your face and explains. 

“We’re not taking the whole group — only a few. I don’t want to raise 
people’s hopes. Besides, it will be safer this way.” 

“Safer?” you gulp. Taking a small group through a maze full of killer 
creatures doesn’t sound safe to you. You’d be happier in a large group — say, 
an army. 

Why does Russell think only a handful of people would be better? 

When you ask, Russell replies, “I don’t want to draw attention to us — 
either from the guy upstairs, or from the maze creatures. They’d be sure to 
spot a big crowd passing through their hunting grounds.” Russell shakes his 
head. “And that would be bad, because where we’re going is the most 
dangerous part of the maze!”

Shuddering, you follow Bob. The angry hissing of the snake-creature 
fades. But you find yourself glancing back every few steps. Anything that 
sounds like a scrape freezes your blood. You don’t want to see that thing ever 
again! 

All too soon, Bob halts. 

“Wait here,” he says, pointing to a doorway. “I’ll get Russell.” 

“Who’s Russell?” you ask. “And why do I have to wait?” 

“Russell is our leader,” Bob replies. “He decides whether or not you can 
join us. Until then, you’re not allowed in our camp.” 

He looks you over again. “Don’t worry, though. I think you’re just what 
we need.” 

Bob goes off, leaving you by the doorway. 

This is great, you think. You’re lost in a maze where giant snake-monsters 
rule. And now you have to wait! Alone! 

Or do you? 

If you follow Bob, turn to PAGE 131 . 

If you obey him and wait, turn to PAGE 20 . 





7 

You dash out to the street, shouting for help. A block away, you find two 
police officers. They give you funny looks as you tell them what happened. 
But they follow you to the store. 

“Here’s the place,” you exclaim, leading them to the Comics Dungeon. 
Hey, that’s weird! The place is locked up. 

Through the window, you see only an empty, dusty shop. It looks as if it’s 
been vacant for months! 

A neighboring store owner has the key. A search shows the place is bare. 
No Milo. No comics. No cellar! 

“I was there! I was!” you insist. 

The police don’t believe you. But when you step outside, you spot Jack 
and Cammie, looking dazed. One officer stares. “I know those kids! They 
disappeared a couple of weeks ago.” 

In the next few days, dozens of lost kids turn up all over town. None of 
them seem to remember where they’ve been. 

No one believes your story. You start to doubt it yourself. Until you find 
the comic you stuffed in your pocket. It’s the first issue of Super-Doer. The 
one from Horace’s slide show. 

Okay, so people don’t believe your story. But they have to believe the 
mansion you bought after you sold your rare comic book for tons of 
money.... 


THE END

You reach into your pocket and grab your keys. They’re the sharpest 
things you have on you. 

Then, lowering your head, you charge! You hold your arm straight out, 
with the longest key jutting out of your fist. “Die, monster!” you yell. 

Quivering purple flesh quakes in front of you. You ram into it at full 
speed. 

But King Jellyjam’s body doesn’t pop like a balloon. It just gives way, 
then bounces back. You’re sent flying — until you’re caught in a giant hand. 

“Die? Is that what you said?” Milo’s voice asks. 

The hand brings you high over the hideous purple face. Rubbery lips open 
to reveal big, stained yellow teeth. Two pink tongues waggle at you as the 
hand lets go. 

Fire. Maybe I should have tried fire, you think as you drop into the huge, 
hungry mouth. 


THE END 



9 

All of you hurry on fearfully. The snuffly noise fades away. After several 
more twists and turns, you find a long, straight hallway. At the end are three 
openings. 

“Watch out for traps,” Jack whispers. ‘Til take the left. Cammie gets the 
middle. You take the right.” 

Sneaking down the hall, you peer through your doorway. Hey! This must 
be the storeroom for the comic shop upstairs. It’s packed with hundreds of 
boxes of comic books! 

Then Cammie calls excitedly, “In here — quick!” 

You and Jack join her in a room that’s very different from the rest of the 
maze. It has wallpaper and a rug. A reading lamp stands beside a big 
armchair. There’s a bed in the corner. 

And there’s a full-length mirror in an old-fashioned frame against one 
wall. Cammie steps up to it — and the mirror begins to glow! She sticks out 
her hand. 

It sinks right in! 

“A magic mirror!” you cry. “Maybe it’s the way out!” 

Cammie stands frozen in front of the mirror. Should you let her try to step 
through? Or will you push in first? 

If you let Cammie go, turn to PAGE 118 . 

If you push ahead, try PAGE 78 . 





10 

No time to worry about where you’re going. You leap into a tornado of 
light. It whirls around you, faster and faster. Your body stretches like taffy.... 

Then, with a SNAP! you’re back to normal. 

You’re in sunshine, in the middle of a street. A horn blares behind you as 
a school bus screeches to a halt. 

Wait a minute. It’s not just any school bus. It’s your school bus. The one 
you missed at the start of this strange adventure! 

“I would’ve stopped,” the annoyed bus driver tells you. “You didn’t have 
to get yourself almost run over.” 

You climb aboard, clutching your schoolbooks. Where did they come 
from? You don’t know. And what happened to Dr. Doof? Certainly, there’s no 
sign of him here. 

A breeze blows a piece of paper through the bus window. It’s a page from 
a comic. It has only one large panel. 

A chill runs down your spine when you see the picture. It shows a 
horrified Dr. Doof, frozen in the act of jumping through a hole in space.... 


THE END 



11 

You form a plan. You just hope you’re right! 

A slimy, purple hand grabs you. “Answer me!” Milo’s voice gurgles out 
of King Jellyjam’s body. “Am I scary enough?” 

Tears run down your face from his stench. You raise a hand to your ear. 
“Eh?” you ask. “What’s that, you say?” 

The creature’s watery yellow eyes bulge out in fury. “Am I scary enough 
for you?” the awful voice roars. 

The smell is growing even worse. You choke and cough. But you manage 
to gasp, “You’ll have to speak up.” 

Milo sucks in a huge breath to yell at you. Snails rattle to the floor as his 
body swells. His hand squeezes you painfully. 

Then it loosens. The yellow eyes cross. King Jellyjam’s body topples with 
a splat ! 

You got it right! In the book, King Jellyjam was suffocated by his own 
stink! You made it happen! 

It seems that the end of Milo means the end of his magic maze, too. The 
walls shimmer and melt, revealing a cave. Not far away, a set of stairs leads 
upward — toward light. 

You start climbing. You just want to go home. Get some rest. Recover 
from your incredible adventure. 

And take a bath! You stink! 


THE END 



12 

You’ve got to see if that two-dollar comic is really the famous first issue 
of Super-Doer. But when you grab the spinner rack, it starts to turn — by 
itself! Still worse, the metal rack seems to have glued itself to your hand. You 
can’t let go! 

Your jaw drops as the moving rack yanks you off your feet. You’re 
dragged around in a circle. And the rack keeps speeding up. 

Soon, to your horror, you can’t touch the floor anymore. It’s like some 
sort of weird carnival ride. The rack is whizzing around, and you’re flying 
through the air! 

“Hey! Hey, mister!” you yell to the store owner. But the words are torn 
from your lips by a screaming wind. You feel as if you’re caught in a tornado. 

You clench your teeth to keep from groaning. Your body is stretched out, 
like you’re a warm piece of taffy. You shift your grip. One hand touches a 
comic on the rack. 

The comic starts to glow. Now, suddenly, there’s a new pull. 

You’re being sucked into the glowing comic! 


Fly to PAGE 103 .

Dr. Doof wags an armored finger at you. “You should have figured it out 
yourself. Whenever my blast-bolts hit your Insecto-Electric Hornet’s Sting, 
there’s a brief tesseract reaction.” 

“A what?” you ask. 

“A hole in space,” Doof explains. “If we fire at each other at close range, 
and I heterodyne my blast-bolts —” 

“In English, please,” you say as politely as you can. 

“And little words, no doubt,” Dr. Doof huffs. “All right. We’ll make a 
hole in space — and step through.” 

Whatever. 

“Let’s do it!” you cry. 

You stand face-to-face with Dr. Doof, readying your weapons. “On three,” 
Doof calls. “One, two ...” 

BABOOOOOM! 

When your eyes finally clear, a shimmering black hole floats between you 
and Dr. Doof. 

Dr. Doof suddenly leaps into the hole. 

“Wait!” you cry. Where does he think he’s going? 

And then you hear him scream! 

If you follow Dr. Doof, turn to PAGE 10 . 

If you look before you leap, turn to PAGE 90 .

You’re going to fight! Even though it takes all your courage just to gaze at 
Milo’s new, rubbery face. 

You try to remember the story you read. The girl who told the story 
managed to defeat King Jellyjam. But how? Terror has got your mind all 
mixed up. 

Did she push King Jellyjam into an oven? No, that was the ending to an 
old fairy tale. 

The gross purple face snorts at you. Your stomach gurgles at the sour 
stink of bad breath. Is that what destroyed King Jellyjam? Did he suffocate 
from his own smell? 

Think! How would you destroy a huge purple body? One that looks just 
like a slime-filled balloon ? Did the girl in the story poke King Jellyjam so he 
popped? 

Those big yellow eyes are getting a nasty look. Time to decide!

When you shout the magic words, the universe does another quick 
change. You spin through the air. Incredible brightness glares around you. 
Then you thud to the floor. 

You shake your head to clear your brain. You seem to be on a stage. You 
must be in an old theater, or something. The blazing light comes from the fist 
of a man wearing black armor, goggles, and a metal face mask. 

It’s Dr. Doof! One of the greatest mad scientists in comics! He’s also 
Ballistic Bug’s worst enemy. 

And right now he’s aiming his armored fists at you. Uh-oh! That means 
he’s going to zap you with a blast-bolt! 

Your brain is frozen with fear, so your body takes over on instinct. The 
gentle hum you’ve been noticing in the background rises into a frantic whine. 
Then you take off in flight! 

Hey! How’d you do that? 


Find out on PAGE 81 . 




16 

You jump back with a horrified scream. These creatures aren’t human! 
They’re ... bugs! 

Oddly enough, when they see you, the bug-people leap back, too. They 
raise sticklike arms in front of their faces. Their buzzing suddenly becomes 
very shrill. 

I must look as scary to them as they do to me! you realize. Fighting back 
your own terror, you manage a friendly smile. What do good aliens say in sci- 
fi comics? Oh, right. 

“I come in peace,” you call. 

Too bad the bug-people don’t speak English. Their buzzing rises to a 
shriek as you walk toward them. You grab your ears at the shrill sounds of 
hundreds of alien screams. It’s worse than the whine of a dentist’s drill! 

Ouch! Go to PAGE 93. 




17 

You turn anxiously to the rest of Y’s Guys. Wolfen-Bean, the Fighting 
Vegetable, and Stinky Stanley look confused. So does Jean Greene. You’re 
not sure what her power is, but you know it involves coming back from the 
dead. 

They’re all fierce fighters. What will they do if they discover you ’re the 
alien Professor Y is talking about? 

“Can you tell us more about these visitors?” you ask. 

“Yeah, Professor,” Jean Greene pipes up. “How do we know they’re 
evil?” 

“Sure,” Wolfen-Bean chimes in. “Maybe they’re just lost, or something.” 

“This isn’t something to vote over,” Professor Y growls. “My marvelous 
mind powers warn me of danger.” He closes his eyes as though he’s listening 
to a tiny voice. 

Then his eyes open wide. “One of the invaders is in this very room! He 
must be a shape-shifter!” 

“Um, Professor,” you begin. 

Professor Y whips around, pointing. “You’re the one!” 


Find out who he’s pointing at on PAGE 134 .

A big gob of goo flies from the creature’s mouth. It misses you, but lands 
on the wall behind you. Immediately, the plywood starts to bubble and hiss! 
The thing’s spit must be acid! If it had touched you ... 

“Run!” Russell shouts. 

Alicia drags you around the corner. After a couple of minutes of running, 
the group slows down. “It’s dangerous, but it’s not fast,” Alicia pants. 

Ahead, Russell and Bob are arguing in whispers. Russell turns to all of 
you. “The Spitter is blocking the path we planned to take,” he explains. “I 
think we should circle around it even though that means spending more time 
in the Danger Zone.” He points at a doorway in the plywood wall. “But Bob 
thinks we can cut through here. The problem is, none of us have been through 
this part of the maze before.” 

Russell looks at your little group. “We’ll take a vote. Which way do you 
want to go?” 


If you go along with Russell, turn to PAGE 24 . 

If you think Bob has a better idea, turn to PAGE 128 . 





19 

I hope I’m doing the right thing, you think. Wings buzzing, you flash 
toward the Doorway to Anywhere. 

Darkness swallows you up. You feel a terrible chill. Invisible forces seize 
your body and hurl you through the blackness. 

And then ... the blackness isn’t so total. In fact, it’s more like gray. You’re 
in a large, shadowy room. Nearby, you see a spinner rack full of comics. 

The Doorway to Anywhere has dumped you back in the comic shop 
where it all started! 

Your wings buzz with joy — 

Wings? 

Hey! You’re still Ballistic Bug! You still have your superpowers! 

Excellent! 

You fly to the front of the shop to confront the weird-looking guy behind 
the counter. This is his store, after all. Whatever is going on, he must know 
about it. And you’ve got a lot of questions you want answered! 


Charge onward to PAGE 76 . 




20 

You wait for a long time. Just when you’re about to give up and wander 
off, Bob returns with another older boy. “This is Russell,” he says. 

The big boss is tall and skinny, with thick glasses. As he gazes down at 
you, you’re reminded of a stork you once saw in a zoo. 

Russell bursts into a big smile. “Perfect, Bob!” he exclaims. “Just the 
right size.” 

You don’t like the sound of that. Your Uncle Mel always says the same 
thing about the turkey at Thanksgiving dinner. “What am I perfect for?” you 
demand. 

“I can’t tell you — yet,” Russell says mysteriously. “Anyway, I’ve got to 
test you first.” 

“Test me?” you cry in disbelief. 

“Yes,” Russell goes on. “I want you to bend your right leg up till you can 
catch hold of your ankle with your right hand.” 

“Are you serious?” you demand. 

“Totally,” Russell replies. “Do it, or you don’t get in.” 

You heard Russell. Standing on one leg, bend your right foot back and 
try to catch your ankle. 


If you succeed, turn to PAGE 79 . 
If you fail, turn to PAGE 133 . 





21 

“I’m there!” you call, sloshing through the puddle. The mystery goo is 
barely an inch deep, but it gushes stickily under your shoes as you walk. Ugh! 

“Let’s book,” you say the moment you reach your friends. 

Whew! Okay, you’re still lost in the Danger Zone. But at least you’re all 
together again. 

Keeping an eye out for traps, the three of you go onward. You’re starting 
to wonder about this Danger Zone, though. “So what’s so dangerous?” you 
ask Cammie and Jack. 

Like an answer, a weird snuffling sound comes from the distance. You 
don’t know what it is. And you don’t want to know what makes it. You, 
Cammie, and Jack start walking faster. 

But the noise behind you comes closer and closer. 

“Is it sniffing out our trail?” you ask worriedly. 

Cammie peers over her shoulder. “It doesn’t have to!” 

Glancing back the way you came, you groan. Stretching behind you is a 
trail ... of big gooey black footprints! 

Thinking fast, you run to a doorway, leaving a clear trail. Then you kick 
off your shoes and toss them as far as you can! 

“Quick. Go the other way!” you whisper. 


Rush to PAGE 9! 




22 

“Okay, I’m ready,” you declare. 

Tex Loudsnore’s test tube crashes down. New puffs of smoke explode 
around you. You’re surrounded by a rainbow-colored cloud. 

It feels as though a giant hand has landed on the top of your head. Down, 
down you go, pushed by this invisible hand. Your bones seem to grind 
together. Your muscles feel as if they’re snapping. 

Every nerve in your body is screaming in pain! 

I never should have trusted Tex Loudsnore! you think in horror. He just 
whipped up a potion to destroy me! 

Is this the end? Find out on PAGE 98! 




23 

“What’s the Danger Zone?” you ask. “And how could it be worse than a 
maze full of monsters?” 

Jack only shakes his head. “No one knows,” he replies. “Nobody’s ever 
come out to tell us.” 

Yikes! You shiver. “So how do we get out?” 

“I bet we aren’t in it yet,” Cammie argues. “After all, somebody marked 
this doorway with the sign.” She taps the scratched D. “That must mean that it 
leads into the Danger Zone, and we should stay away.” 

Jack peeks around the doorway. “Hey!” he bursts out. “There’s a mark on 
the other side of the door, too. That means that this side leads to the Danger 
Zone, too.” 

Jack and Cammie begin to argue again. 

Sighing, you lean back against the plywood wall to rest your feet. 

But when your shoulders hit the wood, the panel suddenly gives under 
your weight! It twirls around like a revolving door and dumps you on the 
other side! 


Spin over to PAGE 87 . 




24 

You trust Russell. After all, he’s the leader. Alicia and Dan agree. The 
group starts to circle around. But after the first set of zigzags, Russell stops. 
“Spiderwebs,” he whispers. 

What’s the big deal? you wonder. Spiders aren’t so scary, compared to the 
maze monsters. 

You peek around the corner — and gasp. The whole hallway is blocked 
by a giant spiderweb! Sitting in the middle, its eyes gleaming, is a spider the 
size of a German shepherd. 

The group sneaks away and tries another path. You walk and turn, turn 
and walk.... 

At last you come to a room that’s different from the rest. The far wall isn’t 
plywood — it’s brick! 

Russell climbs on Bob’s shoulders. He pries out a few of the bricks. Hey, 
there’s a hole in the wall. A tunnel! 

High above, you see a gleam of bright sunlight. 

Everyone turns to you. “It’s up to you,” Russell tells you solemnly. 
“You’re the only one who can save us.” 


Turn to PAGE 78. 




25 

You float in the air in front of the metal monster’s face. It sort of looks 
like Wally, except for the size — and the flashing glass eyes, the metal scales, 
and the giant teeth. 

And, it certainly sounds like Wally — only louder. 

“I can’t believe that the first time you switch, you become a hotshot 
superhero,” he whines. 

“Guess I’m just lucky,” you reply. “But you shouldn’t feel too bad. Being 
a monster is better than being a stupid sidekick.” 

“True,” Wally agrees. “It is cool being a giant monster.” A huge hand 
flashes forward to pluck you out of the air. “Because this monster gets to do 
you in.” 

“Funny, Wally.” You laugh. “Remember, I’m Super-Doer.” 

You flex your supermuscles to get free. 

Nothing happens. You’re still trapped in the Wally-monster’s gigantic 
hand! 


Yikes! Turn to PAGE 46! 




26 

You glance around the building site. There’s a pile of bricks, there’s a 
cement mixer — and there’s a bunch of those steel rods they use to strengthen 
concrete! Exactly what you were looking for! 

You pick up a heavy bar, flex your mighty muscles ... 

Yes! The steel bends like thin wire. 

“Hey!” a voice yells. 

You glance up. A guy in a hard hat is glaring at you. “We were going to 
use that bar,” he complains. “Now you’ve ruined it!” 

You try to straighten it out. But you can’t fix that last kink. Then an idea 
comes to you. 

“I’ll just heat this up with my magma-vision,” you announce. You stare at 
the bent bar cross-eyed, the way Super-Doer does in the comics. Sure enough, 
the metal gets hot — too hot! The middle of the bar melts away! 

Whoops! Guess you need to practice with your cool new powers. 

The workman looks pretty angry. But then he’s distracted by a sudden 
burst of crashes and screams. Another guy in a hard hat dashes up. “Super- 
Doer!” he cries. “Some horrible creature is trying to knock down our 
building!” 


Leap into action on PAGE 59 . 




27 

Bob jumps again, and you help him over. 

“Get down!” he whispers. 

But at that moment, the beast arrives. You freeze in terror. 

Now you know what was making that weird rustling noise. 

The creature has the body of a giant snake. But its head is human. 

Sort of. 

In place of hair, hundreds of tiny snakes wriggle on its scalp! 

A hand grabs your ankle and yanks you down. Bob drags you along in 
silence through several corridors. Then he finally speaks up. “Pretty awful, 
huh? That’s probably the most dangerous monster in the maze. It wraps 
around you, crushing every bone in your body. Then it swallows you. 

Whole!” 


Turn to PAGE 6.

“I don’t want to get this black gunk on my shoes,” you declare. “Hold on 
a minute.” 

You creep along the edge of the big, black puddle. Your back is right 
against the splintery wooden wall. 

About halfway around the puddle, you notice bubbles rising from the 
gluey goo. As they pop, they let out a horrible stink. 

P-U! You squinch up your eyes and hold your nose. 

Bad move! You should have kept an eye on the puddle. When you look 
again, a large, scaly head is rising from the glop. 

That puddle must be a lot deeper than you thought! 

A pale green forked tongue flicks out and wraps around your ankle. You 
can’t pull loose! 

Desperately, you claw at the plywood wall. But there’s nothing to hold on 
to. And Cammie and Jack are too far away to help. You’re dragged into the 
oily black goo. 

You’ve got a sinking feeling. As your head goes under the surface, you 
realize: You’re licked! 


THE END

You gulp. Now you wish you hadn’t been so eager to volunteer. But it’s 
too late to back out. Bob appears with two more bigger kids — Dan and 
Alicia. “Let’s go!” he exclaims. 

The five of you set off. They keep you in the middle. You feel happy 
about that. Then you realize your new “friends” have a reason for keeping 
you safe. You’re the only one who’ll fit through Russell’s way out. 

You wind through the maze. Bob leads, his slingshot ready. Everybody 
glances nervously around. 

Then you hear a loud squishing sound. 

“Oh, no!” Russell cries. “It’s found us!” 

Around the corner comes another horrible creature. This one has the body 
of a slug and a head like a giant squid! 

Alicia grabs you as the thing rears back — and spits!

“Doc! You’ve got to listen to me!” you croak. “I’m not who you think I 
am! I’m not Ballistic Bug!” 

“Sure,” Dr. Doof sneers. “You’re actually the Queen of the May — and 
I’m the King of Albania!” 

“Listen, you idiot!” you rasp. “I’m — urk!” 

The armored gloves tighten on your throat. Too late, you realize this 
wasn’t the time to go insulting Dr. Doof. 

Frantically, you wave your hands, trying to get him to let go. Instead, the 
pressure just increases. 

There’s no talking to him. You’ll have to use the magic words and find 
another, friendlier, mad scientist. 

Your lips form the words, “Guest shot!” But you never speak them. 
Neither words — nor air — can get out of you. 

No air can get in, either! Your lungs ache. Spots dance before your eyes. 
You’re losing consciousness — fast. 

Well, at least, you’ve learned one lesson. 

Mad scientists get mad very, very easily! 


THE END 



31 

You flutter your wings and arrow up into the darkness. 

“Wait! Where are you going?” Dr. Doof cries. 

“I’m going to see if I can get away!” you answer. 

You fly higher. You still don’t see anyone. 

“Hey! Hey!” you yell. “If there’s anyone up there, listen! I’m not really 
Ballistic Bug. I’m just a kid! A kid who got trapped in a magic comic shop!” 

You’re gasping from the effort of flying so high and so fast. White spots 
form before your eyes. 

Wait a minute — they’re not spots. They’re stars ! 

You’re out of time, out of air ... and out of luck. You’re already 
plummeting back to Earth as you black out. 

Next month, the new issue of Ballistic Bug is due to hit the stands. But 
when Horace Grumbacher arrives at his favorite comic shop to buy the new 
comic, it isn’t there! 

“Ballistic Bug has gone out of print,” the store owner explains. “But 
listen, kid. I’ve got a great new comic for you. The superhero is called the 
Powerful Pancake!” 

He holds up a copy of a comic book with a squashed-looking superhero 
on the front. A superhero that looks a lot like you.... 

Too bad. What a flat ending to your story! 


THE END 


32 

“O-okay, I give,” you croak. “You’re scary.” 

The mutated Milo-monster grabs you with huge purple hands. Stinking 
slime oozes over you as he holds you in front of his face. His yellow eyes 
blaze. 

“You’re sure?” he demands. “You’re sure I’m scary?” 

You can’t answer, because you’re holding your breath. Boy, does he reek\ 
The sour stench washes over you. You can feel it on your face. It stings. Like 
acid. 

Milo shakes you. “Answer me!” his monster voice booms. 

“Yes!” you scream. “Yes, I’m sure you’re scary!” 

Now it’s not only your face that hurts. The skin all over your body seems 
to bubble and sag. So do the organs inside. Even your bones seem to be 
melting. 

“What — what’s happening to me?” you scream. 

Your throat feels clogged with slime, and your eyes go all blurry.... 


Will you be able to read what happens on PAGE 113 ? 



33 

The crowd still isn’t moving, and the robot is only a couple of giant steps 
away. 

“Have you used these magic words?” you ask. 

Wally nods. “I started out in another comic. I was some superhero’s dopey 
sidekick. Then I met Alex, and we came here. All you have to do is think of 
another comic, and say the magic words.” 

“Okay. That gets you to another comic. But isn’t there a way to get back 
home? Back to the real universe?” you ask. 

Wally glances at you. “I think so. A mad scientist can send you. But you 
have to talk him into helping you.” 

You can barely hear him. People are screaming and bumping into you. 
“What’re the magic words?” you beg. 

Wally closes his eyes, thinking. Then he yells, “Guest shot!” 

And he disappears! 

You think of the two comics you’d been studying on the comic rack. Both 
of them have mad-scientist villains. Will the magic words take you to them? 

Time to find out! You close your eyes.

Tex Loudsnore cackles with glee. “How do you like my new batch of 
creature creator, Super-Doer? It even works on you!” 

He grins evilly up at you. “I believe you’re my finest creation. You’re the 
biggest and scariest of them all.” 

You take one angry, giant step toward Loudsnore. 

The mad scientist yells, “Freeze, ugly!” 

Your muscles suddenly lock up. You can’t move at all. In fact, you nearly 
fall on your horrible, tusked face! 

Tex Loudsnore puts his hands in his pockets and beams up at you. “Best 
of all, my formula makes you my absolute slave. Now, you just stand there. 
Don’t move a muscle until I decide what to do with you.” 

You try desperately to move — but you can’t! 

Uh-oh! Can you move on to PAGE 67 ? 




35 

You recognize the other hero. It’s Stinky Stanley, the mutant whose 
horrible breath is his weapon. 

“The professor is waiting,” Stinky Stanley calls. 

Professor Yves Yaboum is also known as Professor Y. He’s a powerful 
mutant, the leader of Y’s Guys ... and a famous scientist. 

You follow Stinky Stanley to join the rest of Y’s Guys. Then a flying 
chair enters the room. Seated in it is Professor Y! 

He’s hard to miss — after all, he’s covered completely in bright red hair. 

In fact, he looks like an ape, except for those serious, wise eyes. 

“Y’s Guys!” he exclaims in a deep voice. “My mental powers have 
detected a disturbance in the great flow of being. Somehow, aliens from 
beyond this universe have invaded.” 

You gulp. Could Professor Y be talking about you? 

You hope not. Especially when you hear what else he’s got to say. 

“We must destroy these invaders immediately!” 

To ask Professor Y more about these aliens, turn to PAGE 1 7 .

You’ll have to be fast — very fast — to veer away from the building. And 
there are other buildings all around you. You’ll have to avoid them too! 

There’s only one direction to go. Tilting your body so it faces straight up, 
you pour on the speed. 

Up, up you go. Faster. Faster. Now your body is a mere streak. You zoom 
past the building. Whoa. You’re really moving! 

In fact, you’re moving so fast, you can’t slow down. The air is getting 
thin. The sky darkens until you’re in the blackness of outer space. There’s no 
air at all out here. But that’s all right. Super-Doer can hold his superbreath. 

A second later, you notice something large and gray in your path. Oh, no! 
It’s the moon! 

Your superskin and maximuscles might have survived a crash into a 
house. But the moon is a different story. 

“Aaaaaaaah!” you scream. 

Nobody hears you in outer space. The air simply gets sucked out of your 
lungs. You don’t even have the breath to yell, “Guest shot!” before you splat 
into the moon. 


THE END 



37 

I’ll stick with a power I’ve used already, you decide. 

You stare slightly cross-eyed at the big vault door, the way Super-Doer 
looks when he uses his magma-vision. 

Nothing happens. 

You try again. And again. You stare so hard, your head begins to pound. 
You’re getting angry. All you see is red. 

But you smell something odd — scorching paper. 

You remember the time you burned a hole through a comic book by 
focusing sunlight through a magnifying glass. The paper turned brown, then it 
burned. 

Suddenly, you notice that the flat, brightly colored world around you is 
changing color. Everything is getting brown. The sharp, burning smell is 
growing stronger. 

Finally, it hits you. You’re in a comic book now! And somehow, your 
magma-vision has set the paper on fire! 

You suck in breath to yell, “Guest shot.” 

But when you inhale, the smoke sends you into a coughing fit. You can’t 
get the words out! 

Flames crackle. Your body may be super, but it’s only as strong as the 
paper it’s printed on. 

Is it getting hot in here, or is it you? 

Actually, it’s 


THE END! 

38 

“What script?” you sputter. 

“Oh, ha-ha, very funny,” Dr. Doof snaps. He shifts his grip on your throat. 
“The script says you’re supposed to beat me by shaking the floor to pieces 
with your Super-Sonic Buzz-a-ronic power. But, no, you have to make a 
grandstand play with your little lightning bolt! Thanks a lot! I could have 
gotten hurt!” 

Well... wasn’t that the idea? 

You blink in confusion behind your helmet-mask. This is too weird. Is Dr. 
Doof saying that all those great comic battles — the ones you’ve always 
loved — are rigged? 

Oh, well. At least that explains how the superheroes always win. 

But you can’t think about that right now. A furious Dr. Doof is hissing in 
your ear, “Well? I want some answers, bug!” 

You gurgle as his steel fingers tighten around your throat! 

Take a deep breath and apologize on PAGE 83 . 




39 

Bob moves confidently through the maze. In some areas, though, he 
motions for you to be quiet. You tiptoe along. And you notice that he keeps 
his slingshot ready. 

“This maze is an abandoned subbasement for the whole block,” Bob 
explains. “It’s full of crazy, mixed-up animals. Each has its own hunting 
ground.” 

“And you fight them with that?” You point to Bob’s slingshot. 

Bob shrugs. “It’s ah we’ve got,” he admits. “I was lucky with the lion- 
thing. It just hates getting hit in the nose!” 

Soon after, a weird noise echoes through the maze. SHHHHH! SHHHH! 

Bob stops. His face turns pale. 

“What —” you begin. 

He shakes his hand at you. “Quiet!” he whispers. 

Bob seems to be listening carefully. You realize he’s trying to figure out 
where the sound is coming from. 

At last he makes up his mind. “It’ll be here in a second,” he whispers. 
“Come on.” 

He boosts you up to the top of the wall, then leaps himself. 

And misses! He bangs against the plywood. Then you hear a loud hissing 
sound. 


Go to PAGE 27.

“Why?” you ask. “Why did you do this to us?” 

Milo looks at you in surprise. “You know, you’re the only one who ever 
asked. This is the deal, kid. I’ve got a shot at a comeback. One of the TV 
networks wants to make a show out of The Cellar of Scary Stories. ” 

He frowns. “But they’re not sure my stuff is scary enough. So I got my 
old creature crew together and GLOMPFed a bunch of you kids to see if 
we’ve still got it. What do you think?” 

You remember the slow-moving Frankenstein, the snoozing mummy, the 
toothless werewolf. “To tell you the truth,” you answer, “your creatures seem 
pretty ... lame.” 

“Lame?” Milo growls. “LAME?” 

Your prisoner flings you off. 

Uh-oh. 

“H-hey, guys?” you call to the other kids. “Uh — I could use a little 
help....” 

Milo makes a magical gesture. All the other kids disappear! You’re alone 
with Milo the Mutant! 

“So.” Milo glares at you. “The greatest monsters of all time aren’t scary 
enough for you. You think you could do better?” 


Answer Milo on PAGE 135. 




41 

You try to run, but the snake-thing moves fast. 

Its scaly body catches you in the shins. You stumble and fall to the floor. 
Before you can get up, the thing twists around you. 

You can’t move an arm or a leg. Thick coils of muscle have you all tied 
up. 

The snake-thing’s human face stares into your eyes as its grip slowly 
tightens. 

The creature’s lips stretch in an evil smile. 

“You’re sssso ssssmall, I should let you grow a bit more,” it hisses. 

“Really?” you squeak. 

The snake’s smile grows bigger and wider until its mouth is large enough 
to swallow you whole. 

“Naaaah,” the snake replies. “Just kidding!” 

GULP! 


THE END 



42 

Dr. Doof wants to conquer your world? You never thought of that 
possibility when you asked for his help. 

You’ve got to stop him! But how? 

Then you notice something. Even though you’re halfway into your own 
universe, you’ve still got the costume and the wings of Ballistic Bug. You can 
stop Dr. Doof just the way the hero does in the comics! 

“Oh, no, you don’t, Doof!” you cry. You try to leap forward and grab Dr. 
Doof. 

But you can’t move. 

The hole in the universe has shrunk — and you’re stuck! 

Dr. Doof laughs. “Soon the hole will close completely. It’s curtains for 
you, Bug!” Then he strolls off to terrorize your hometown. 

“Doof! Come back!” you shout helplessly. 

Well, at least your top half made it home safely. But the shrinking hole 
cuts off your rear 


END. 



43 

Looks as if luck is against you! You fall way short of the boy’s reaching 
hands. 

Instead, you bang into the wall, then crash to the floor. 

You lie there, frozen. The lion-bull-eagle beast clomps closer. It growls in 
triumph. 

Then the beast leaps backward suddenly, yelping in pain. It paws at its 
nose. 

What happened? Well — maybe luck is with you after all! 

You look up. The boy is still leaning over the wall. He holds a slingshot in 
his hand. 

“Try again!” he yells. 

You scramble to your feet. The patchwork beast lets out a furious roar. 

Zing! Something flies past your ear. The beast yelps again. Bull’s-eye! 
Right in the snout! 

You leap again. A hand catches your wrist and hauls you up. 

But the lion-creature is right behind you! 


Head on up to PAGE 129 . 




44 

Milo’s ears twitch. He begins to turn around. 

He heard you! 

“Everybody run!” you yell. 

Jack and Cammie take off as if they’re training for the Olympics. You try 
your best to keep up. You can’t let them out of your sight, or you’ll be totally 
lost. 

Your lungs are burning by the time your new friends stop. “Where are 
we?” Jack asks. 

Cammie stares. “What do you mean? I thought you were keeping track of 
our route!” 

They begin to argue. Great! Now you’re all lost! 

Jack suddenly breaks off and stares at the wall. He points. “Look!” 

Both Jack and Cammie turn pale. 

You glance at the symbol scratched into the plywood beside the doorway. 
A capital D. 

“What does it mean?” you ask. 

“D stands for danger,” Cammie whispers. She looks scared. “It means 
we’ve reached the Danger Zone!”

45 

Kid? You peer down. 

You’re not Super-Doer anymore. You’re yourself! 



Hey! This is the vacuum store that was next to the comic shop! “I was 
trapped in the comic shop,” you gasp, pointing. 

“You couldn’t have been,” the old man declares. “That place has been 
closed for years.” 

Huh? 

You describe the comic shop owner. The old man gives you an odd look. 
“That was Milo. He died three years ago.” 

Whoa ... have you traveled in time? 

You ask for today’s date. It’s the same day as when you left for school this 
morning! 

You dash outside, heart pounding wildly. The stores all look the same — 
except one. The windows of the comic shop are boarded up. The nails on the 
plywood panels are all rusty. The shop has obviously been sealed up for years. 

You head for home, totally creeped out. 

Could it have been a dream? It seemed so real.... 

One thing is certain. You’ll never take another walk through this 
neighborhood. And you hope you’ll never, ever find yourself in the comic 
shop of horrors again. 


THE END 



46 

“Wally,” you cry. “Why are you doing this? We’re pals — well, maybe 
not pals. But we go to the same school!” 

“I’m sorry,” Wally replies. “But the monster formula also makes me Tex 
Loudsnore’s slave. He told me to destroy Super-Doer.” 

Uh-oh. Things are desperate. You give the Wally-monster a blast of your 
magma-vision. His shoulder begins to melt. 

“Ow! Owww!” he yells. “I can’t take this! I’m getting out of here! Guest 
shot!” 

But when he yells the magic words, Wally doesn’t vanish. A ripple runs 
through his giant form. The fingers around you feel strangely rubbery. His 
face looks runny. 

He’s melting! 

Then you realize: Wally’s time has come. He used the magic words once 
too often. He’s turning into an inkblot! 

You strain to break away. You can’t get free! 

Holding up your hands in front of your face, you see with horror that 
you’re getting runny, too. 

Bummer! 

Your Uncle Mel always called you a little squirt. 

But now you’ve turned into a big drip. 


THE END 



47 

No problem, you tell yourself. I’ll memorize my route! 

To make it easier, you decide to make only right turns. That works for the 
first four choices you face. Then you find yourself in a room with only one 
doorway — on the left. 

By the tenth choice, you’re mumbling to yourself, trying to remember 
which way you went. This place is definitely a maze. And it’s bigger than the 
basement of the small comic shop. You feel as if you’ve been walking for 
miles. How can that be? 

The next room you find is stacked high with old copies of The Cellar of 
Scary Stories. They’re all the same issue that Horace showed you a slide of. 
The guy with the face like a warty pumpkin is the series host. His name is 
Milo the Mutant. 

Hey! Now you realize why the comic shop owner seemed familiar. He 
looks just like Milo the Mutant! 

This is starting to get creepy. 

Then you hear a noise echoing through the maze. A slow, scraping sound 
— like a foot dragging on concrete. 

Someone — or something — is following you! 

What should you do? 

If you go back and see who’s following you, turn to PAGE 89 . 

If you ’d rather get out of there — fast! — turn to PAGE 50 . 





48 

You spin out of control, thanks to that shot from Wally. Wind blasts past 
you, making your cape whip about until it wraps around your head. You’re 
ready to barf from all the tumbling. And your cape is blinding you. 

Wait a second! You’re Super-Doer. And Super-Doer can see through 
things with his cosmic-ray vision! 

You try that slightly squinty look that Super-Doer gets when he uses this 
power. 

The good news is that you can now see where you’re going. 

The bad news is that you’re about to crash into a building! 

To use your flying powers to veer away, turn to PAGE 36 . 

If you’d rather rely on your superskin and maximuscles to get you through 
safely, turn to PAGE 94 . 





49 

“I — I could use a rest,” you gasp. 

Dr. Doof releases you. “ALL RIGHT!” he yells, glaring into the darkness 
overhead. “We’re taking a break! Put in an ad or something. Ballistic and I 
need to talk.” 

You stare upward. Who’s he talking to up there? 

When you ask, the mad scientist shrugs in his armor. “Whoever runs this 
crazy world must be up there. That’s where our scripts come from, anyway.” 

A brilliant idea bursts in your brain. Maybe you don’t need the help of a 
mad scientist to get home. Maybe you can take your problem right to the 
person — or people — in charge of the Comic Books Universe! 

If you stick with Dr. Doof, turn to PAGE 95 . 

If you’d rather go over his head, turn to PAGE 31 . 





50 

You walk faster and faster, until you break into a run. At first, the 
footsteps fade. Then you hear loud clomping. It sounds as if there’s a herd of 
elephants hot on your heels! 

You glance back as you go through a doorway. “Ow!” you yell. You brush 
against jagged plywood. A two-inch splinter stab you in the arm! 

Gritting your teeth, you pull the splinter out. Blood stains your T-shirt. 
From several turns behind you comes a rumbling roar. Uh-oh. Can whatever 
is chasing you smell blood? 

The clomping sound turns into a crashing gallop. 

You try to run faster. Flinging yourself through another doorway, you find 
yourself in a long hall. You’re running flat out. But the stomping feet are right 
behind you. 

One look over your shoulder — and you scream. 

The creature chasing you looks as if it were sewn together from several 
different animals. It has the body of a shaggy bull and huge, feathered eagle 
wings. 

Worst of all, it has the head — and fangs — of a lion! 


Run for your life to PAGE 54 ! 




51 

You head down the stairs. But after your first step, the whole stairway 
begins to shake. It’s as if heavy machinery is working underneath. 

The stair treads under your feet suddenly tilt. They crash down with an 
echoing mechanical sound. GLOMPF! 

Now you know! 

The stairway has turned itself into a slide! Your feet skid out from under 
you, and you bang your elbow. You’re going faster, and you can’t stop! You 
claw frantically at the slide. But you can’t get a grip on the smooth metal. You 
don’t even slow down — you just make a noise like nails on a blackboard. 

It makes a good blend with your screams as you zoom faster and faster, 
deeper into the dark ... 

Speed on to PAGE 127 . 




52 

Even if you climbed on one another’s shoulders, you wouldn’t make it up 
to the ceiling. But then you get an idea.... 

“Follow me!” you cry. Rushing to the storeroom, you pull on a box of 
comics. “We can use these to build a stairway!” 

Jack and Cammie leap into action. You shift box after box, banging and 
crashing. These things are heavy! 

“What’s that noise? What are you doing?” Milo yells from his mirror. 

“Am I going to have to come down there?” 

You’re too busy to answer. You pile up a stairway of boxes. Jack and 
Cammie hold it steady as you scramble up. 

The pile begins to shudder. As the cartons fall apart, you leap, clinging to 
the edge of the trapdoor. It takes all your strength, but you pull yourself 
through. You made it! 

“I’ll get help!” you call down to Cammie and Jack. 

You peer around. You’re behind the counter in the comic shop! The whole 
building shakes as boxes crash below. Comics flutter up through the hole. You 
grab one in midair and shove it in your pocket as you run for the door. 

Below, Milo screams wildly. “You can’t get away!” he howls. “You’ll ruin 
everything!” 


Hurry to PAGE 7 . 




53 

Static electricity crackles around you. Lightning bolts zap from your head 
to blast the deadly hair balls in midair. 

“Good shooting, RAY-ge!” Jean Greene shouts. 

The other Y’s Guys mob the professor. When the smoke clears, all that’s 
left of him is a scorched spot on the rug. His mental powers were right. He 
was in deadly danger! 

You turn to Wolfen-Bean. “How — ?” you begin. 

The bean-warrior shrugs. “A couple of months ago, I walked into this 
weird comic shop and reached for this rack ...” Wolfen-Bean grins. “It’s cool. 

I like being a superhero!” 

“But what about the danger?” you ask. “You could turn into an inkblot!” 

“What are you talking about?” Wolfen-Bean demands. 

You explain. 

“No way,” Wolfen-Bean scoffs. “We’ve got it made! Watch. Guest shot!” 

“Stop!” you shout. 

Too late. The bean-man’s body shudders. He’s melting! 

The rest of Y’s Guys glare at you. 

“YOU!” Stinky Stanley shouts. “This is all your fault!” 


Defend yourself on PAGE 132 . 




54 

Hot breath ruffles your hair. The lion’s roar deafens you. 

When your ears stop ringing, you hear a voice yell, “Up here!” 

You peer up to find a kid leaning over the plywood wall above you. He 
stretches out his arms to you. 

“Jump!” he yells. “I’ll pull you over!” 

You don’t need another invitation. You leap as high as you can, reaching 
for the boy’s hands. 

Will you make it? Is luck on your side? 

Take a look at the hour hand on the clock. 

If it’s close to an odd-numbered hour — one, three, five, seven, nine, or

o ’clock — turn to PAGE 80. 





55 

This is kind of fun, you think. At last you’re getting the hang of this 
superhero thing! 

You buzz around the room, throwing punches at the air. You want to be 
ready for Dr. Doof’s next attack. 

Then you notice that the evil doctor isn’t getting up. He lies sprawled on 
the stage, helpless. Not moving. 

Hmm. That shock shouldn’t have knocked all the fight out of him, you 
think. In fact, his super-armor should have protected him against your 
Insecto-Electric Hornet’s Sting. 

Apparently, it didn’t work this time. 

You start to get nervous. “Uh — Doc?” you call. You hover over the 
doctor’s flat form. Is he still breathing? 

Doof’s metal-muscled hand moves like a striking snake. Before you can 
buzz off, he grabs you by the throat! 


If you try to break free, turn to PAGE 119 . 

If you try to reason with Dr. Doof, turn to PAGE 30 . 





56 

You fire your Insecto-Electric Hornet’s Sting at Dr. Doof from across the 
room. 

And miss! Your shot smacks into a blast-bolt Dr. Doof had aimed at you. 

The two bolts of energy explode together, throwing off rainbow-colored 
sheets of flame. But in the middle of the fireworks display, there’s a gaping 
black hole. 

“Behold!” Dr. Doof cries in a loud, hammy voice. “Our battle has sheared 
the very fabric of the universe. This hole could be a Doorway to Anywhere!” 

Anywhere? you think. 

Could it be a way out of this crazy Comic Books Universe? 

You buzz forward, ready to zip through. Then you think again. 

Doorway to Anywhere? That sounds kind of risky. 

Maybe you should let Dr. Doof go first. 

If you go through the Doorway to Anywhere, turn to PAGE 19 . 

If you let Dr. Doof test it first, turn to PAGE 100 . 





57 

You eye the Wally-Monster suspiciously. “Why didn’t you ask Tex 
Loudsnore to get us out of the Comic Books Universe?” you demand. 

“I didn’t get a chance,” Wally replies, sulking. “The second I entered his 
lab, he got me with creature-creator juice.” 

Sounds likely. “Go and turn yourself in to the police,” you order. “I’ll deal 
with Tex Loudsnore!” 

Leaping high into the sky, you head for Mount Skull. In the comic, Super- 
Doer never managed to find out where his archenemy’s hideout was. But, 
since you read the comics, you know exactly how to get there. 

Minutes after leaving Bigg City, you spot a mountain shaped like a skull. 
You fly into the giant skull’s left eye. It’s a cave that leads deep into the 
mountain. 

Twenty feet inside, your path is blocked by a steel door. With your Super- 
Doer powers, you know you can get through the steel door and talk with Tex 
Loudsnore. 

The question is, which power should you use?

You stumble out of the cave and into the bright sunlight of this comic¬ 
book world. 

A tiny dot comes zooming down out of the sky. 

What now? you wonder miserably. A missile? A meteor? 

No, worse. It’s Gnatman, Super-Doer’s superhero buddy! 

“Hold it right there, monster!” a whiny voice roars out from the hero’s 
mouth. 

Could it possibly be? 

“Wally!” you yell. “You’ve got to help me!” 

But once again, your words come out as a rush of flames. Gnatman 
flutters his gnat wings and zips out of the way. 

“Oh, you want to play rough, huh?” Wally’s voice sounds just like a 
gnat’s annoying buzz. 

But then he starts flitting around you, raining blows at super insect speed. 
WHAP! KAPOW! BLAM! 

It’s more than annoying. It’s downright painful! 

BAP! You crumple to the ground. Your giant body raises a huge cloud of 
dust. You start sneezing uncontrollably. 

And that’s just the beginning of your torture. 

Oh, by the way — it’s also the beginning of 


THE END! 



59 


For a second you wonder what you’re supposed to do. Then you 
remember. You’re a superhero! It’s your duty to save the building. 

You leap up — and suddenly you’re flying! Wind ruffles your hair. Your 
cape flaps behind you as you soar high over the building. You look down ... 
and your jaw drops. 

Just flying is incredible enough. But you didn’t expect this! 

Something the size and shape of a Tyrannosaurus rex is smashing at the 
building with its hands and tail. But the thing’s scaly skin is made of shining 
metal. And your cosmic-ray vision shows that there’s machinery inside. 

The creature turns its glowing glass eyes on you. You expect an attack. 

Instead, the robot dinosaur says in a whiny voice, “Oh, great! Now I’ve 
got Super-Doer after me.” 

You skid to a stop in midair. You know that voice. 

“Wally?” you cry in disbelief. 

If you try to talk things out with Wally, go to PAGE 25 . 

If you’d rather fight him, go to PAGE 102 .

You leap straight into the air and zoom past Cammie and Jack. For the 
next few twists and turns through the maze, you lead the way. They finally 
catch up with you. 

“Take it easy,” Jack pants. “Old Menes probably went right back to 
sleep.” 

“Yeah,” Cammie adds. “After a couple of thousand years, he needs his 
rest.” 

“That — that —” you gasp. “That really was a mummy?” 

Cammie nods. “The maze is full of old-time monsters. That’s why you 
have to —” 

“Look out!” Jack suddenly yells. 

You turn, just in time to see a figure leap from the top of the maze wall. 
All you see is a pair of blazing red eyes, flying toward you. 

There’s barely time to raise an arm to protect yourself. The eyes are right 
on you. You feel hot breath on your face ... 

Then jaws clamp shut on your arm! 


Use your free hand to turn to PAGE 101 . 




61 

But what comic will you jump to? 

One of your favorites is Silent Sal, the comic book about teenagers. But 
there are no mad scientists there. Well, you could try Super-Doer. 

But you’d better make up your mind fast. Ballistic Bug is zooming 
straight at you. 

He’s going to flatten you! 

Hey! You’ve got it. There’s another comic book that you like. It’s about a 
supergroup of mutants, Y’s Guys. Their leader is a superscientist! That’s the 
same thing as a mad scientist, right? 

Ballistic Bug’s fist is about a foot from your nose. 

Keeping the Y’s Guys in mind, you yell, “Guest shot!” 

Just before his fist connects with your jaw, Ballistic Bug fades out. 

Whew! 

You start to fade in on another scene. But before you can make out any 
details — 

“Look out!” a voice yells. 


Fade in fully on PAGE 74 . 




62 

Pretending you’re still frozen, you watch Loudsnore work at his 
computer. The huge, complex machine even speaks! 

“New data entered from manipulation of transuniversal phlogiston,” the 
computer reports. 

Huh? Oh, well. Just because the computer can speak doesn’t mean you 
can understand it. 

The mad scientist turns to you. “I’ve decided what to do with you,” he 
announces. “I’ve sent for another of my creatures. I’m going to send you both 
to destroy Bigg City!” 

You can’t keep still any longer. This calls for action! 

You wait until Loudsnore turns his back. Then you lean down and scoop 
him up. “In your dreams, Loudsnore,” you growl. 

“You can’t do this!” Loudsnore sputters. “I control you!” 

“Wrong,” you reply. “Right now, I control you!” 

Whoa! This is pretty excellent! 

“First,” you tell him, “I want you to change me back to Super-Doer.” You 
figure it would be a good idea to have superpowers while dealing with Tex. 
“And next —” 

But your next demand is drowned out. Thunderous footfalls echo through 
the cavern! 


What now? Find out on PAGE 88.

“But, Professor, why?” you blurt. 

“Yes?” the professor replies. 

“No — I mean, Professor, why —” 

“That’s my name,” Professor Y snaps. “Don’t wear it out.” 

“I — I mean —” you stammer. You try again. “Why do you want to attack 
these visitors, professor?” 

Professor Y’s eyes gleam. “If you have to ask that, you’re no true Y’s 
Guy!” he declares. “You’re an alien spy!” 

His hair starts to grow, reaching out to you. You’ve seen pictures of this in 
the comics. But actually seeing the hair creeping around is, well, creepy. 

Whoops! You spent too much time staring. When you tear your gaze 
away, you notice that tentacles of hair have wound around your ankles. You 
can’t pull free! 

There’s only one thing you can do now. It’s risky. But you’ve got to use 
the magic words. 

“Guest — mmmmmph!” Your cry is muffled as still more hair attacks 
you, stuffing your mouth. 

There’s no escape now. Your doom is too horrible to describe. How 
horrible? 

Let’s just say that from here on, it gets really hairy.... 


THE END 



64 

“Why should I trust you, Loudsnore?” you demand. “How do I know 
what’s in that test tube?” 

“I’ve got a Super-Doer robot you can test it on,” Tex Loudsnore suggests. 

You shrug. Sounds reasonable. “Where is it?” you ask. 

“I keep it in that special box over there.” Loudsnore points to a man-sized 
metal container by his lab table. 

The box has no seams. There’s no lid, no way to open it. So you crack it 
in two. Out pops a six-foot chunk of glowing, orangey-gray rock. 

It lands on your foot — and sinks in! 

Tex Loudsnore cackles. “That’s Ziptite, the one substance in the universe 
that can kill you, Super-Doer! In case you’re wondering, it will do the job, 
even though you’re a giant lizard with tusks.” 

You hardly hear. Searing pain shoots up your leg and through your body. 
Black spots appear before your eyes. And grow. 

The poison rock is all through you now. You’re done for. You topple to 
the ground. 

Your one consolation is that you land on Loudsnore! 


THE END 



65 

Your heart is pounding so hard, you can barely hear anything. But you 
strain your ears as you tiptoe down the shadowy corridors. You peek carefully 
around every corner. 

You can’t hear Frankenstein’s shuffling footsteps anymore. Even his roars 
of “NYAARRGH!” have faded away. 

You’ve lost him! 

With a sigh of relief, you lean against a plywood wall. A moth flutters 
past you. And a hand grabs it in midair. 

Hey! That’s not your hand! 

You spin around to face two kids about your own age — a red-haired girl 
and a boy with shaggy dark hair. He’s chewing on something. Both give you 
odd, closemouthed smiles. 

“I’m Cammie, and this is Jack,” the girl tells you. “I guess you got 
GLOMPFed, just like we did.” 

“How long have you guys been here?” you ask. 

“We’re not sure.” Jack swallows noisily. “But I know I had short hair 
when I got here.” 

You look at Jack’s wild mane. This is bad news. 


Go to PAGE 117. 




66 

You shriek at the top of your lungs, “Guest shot!” 

When you open your eyes, everything is still dark. For a second, you 
think it’s the shadow of the robot’s foot coming down. Then you realize: It’s 
nighttime! 

With a sigh, you lean against a nearby brick wall. You made it! You’re 
safe! Of course, now you have to find out where you are. Too bad it’s so 
dark.... 

Suddenly, yellow light glares around you. You blink. You’re blinded! 

Then you hear a faint buzz. It rises to a whine. Your dazzled eyes see a figure 
in a tight brown costume with flashing insect wings coming out its back. 

Ballistic Bug! 

“You’re in big trouble,” the bug says menacingly. 

Trouble? You look down. There are tools in your hand. You also notice an 
open safe next to you. 

Uh-oh. 

You’re a burglar. Ballistic Bug doesn’t like burglars. 

You’d better jump to someplace new — and fast!

Whistling, Tex Loudsnore putters around the lab. He walks past you as if 
you were a huge statue. 

You can’t even move your mouth to say the magic words that would 
whisk you out of here. 

Now he’s working on some sort of formula. Smoke wafts up to the ceiling 
of the cave — right past your giant nose. The smell is nasty. You twitch your 
nostrils to keep from sneezing. 

Wait a minute! Tex Loudsnore told you not to move a muscle, but you 
moved ! Maybe the formula doesn’t work as well as Tex thinks. Maybe this 
“absolute slave” thing is fading away! 

You decide to test your theory. You try bending the little finger on your 
right hand. (Of course, now that “little finger” is four feet long!) 

The finger finally bends. Next you work on your hands and feet. Finally, 
you turn your head. 

The mad scientist is still working. He hasn’t noticed. 

How are you going to use your freedom? 

If you jump Tex Loudsnore, turn to PAGE 73 . 

If you keep still and spy on him, go to PAGE 62 . 





68 

You suck in as much air as you can. Then you let it out with a WHOOSH! 
as if you were blowing out the candles on the biggest birthday cake in the 
world. 

The door flies off its hinges and lands with a crash in the long hallway 
beyond. 

As you walk down the corridor, you find that Tex Loudsnore has other 
defenses. All sorts of weapons attack you. 

But you’re Super-Doer! Deadly poison gas only makes you sneeze. And 
Tex Loudsnore’s disintegrator beam merely gives you a terrible itch! 

“Wow!” you exclaim. “This is incredible!” 

You could get used to being a comic book hero. 

The hallway ends at another steel door. No problem. Winding up, you 
smack it with your Power-Punch! 


See what happens on PAGE 136 . 




69 

“Yikes!” you shout. “Everybody run!” 

You push. You shove. You try to get out of the giant robot’s path. But the 
crowd is too thick. You’re trapped. 

“Hey!” a whiny voice says in your ear. “I know you!” 

You turn and spot a familiar face in the crowd. It’s a kid from school 
named Wally. Come to think about it, he hasn’t been in class lately. 

“Where are we?” you cry. “What’s going on?” 

“You just got here on the spinner-rack express, huh?” Wally asks. “Okay, 
I’ll make this fast. You’re stuck inside a comic — in the Comic Books 
Universe.” 

You roll your eyes. “Yeah, right.” 

“It’s true!” Wally insists. “Now, here’s the deal. We can shift from comic 
to comic, using a magic word. But if you use it too often, you’ll turn into an 
inkblot.” He shudders. “It happened to the kid I was with. Alex. He tried to 
leave this comic. Now he’s just a smear.” 

You glance anxiously at the robot. It’s awfully close. 

“We’ll be smeared, too, if we don’t get out of here!” you declare. 


Turn to PAGE 33. 




70 

You think hard. Then you yell, “Guest shot!” 

Instantly, the shadows vanish in bright fluorescent light. 

“Golly,” a voice says in your ear. “Look at that!” 

You gaze around. Huh? You’re in the middle of a bunch of school kids 
dressed in old-fashioned clothes. What’s the deal? You expected to find 
yourself in another adventure of Ballistic Bug. Instead, you’ve been dropped 
into some nerdy school trip. 

Nervously, you glance upward. With your luck, another giant robot will 
turn up any second. 

“Gosh, Peewee,” the girl beside you exclaims. “We’re visiting a nuclear 
power plant! Isn’t this neat?” 

“Yeah,” a bigger kid with a black crew cut sneers. “Maybe for a dweeb 
like Peewee Parkbench.” 

Is he talking about you? 

You glance down at yourself. Your eyes bug out. Weirder and weirder! 
You’ve changed into a nerdy-looking character in a bow tie. 

Then you realize who you’re supposed to be. 

Peewee Parkbench, the secret identity of Ballistic Bug! 


Turn to PAGE 72. 




71 

“Well,” you reason, “if Frankenstein catches up to me again, I can always 
run faster.” 

But the idea of Frankenstein popping up again worries you. You turn to 
glance over your shoulder as you run. 

BONK! 

You see stars. You ran straight into a wall! 

You glance quickly around the room. 

Hmm. 

There’s no way out, except for the doorway you entered. 

And standing in that doorway is ... 

Frankenstein. 

The creature doesn’t even snarl as it stalks toward you. You’re caught, fair 
and square. 

And, as Frankenstein starts painfully trying to unscrew your head from 
your neck, you remember how the monster caught its victims. 

They all wound up running into a dead 

END. 



72 

The kid with the buzzcut pushes past, stomping on your toes. 

“Hey!” you complain in a geeky voice. “Watch it!” 

“Make me,” Buzzcut sneers. 

You grin. Okay, he asked for it. 

You try to call upon Ballistic Bug’s insect strength. 

Nothing happens! 

Then you remember what the girl next to you said. This must be the 
famous visit to the nuclear plant. The one where Peewee gets his incredible 
superpowers. 

You don’t have them ... yet. 

Get the details on PAGE 120. 




73 

It’s a simple choice. Of course you jump Tex Loudsnore! 

Not that it’s easy. He runs around, yelling, “Halt! Stop! I command you!” 
And you have to be careful not to stomp him accidentally. He’s your ticket out 
of this crazy comic-book world! 

Finally, you catch him. Holding him carefully in one fist, you bring the 
mad scientist up to your face. “You’re going to help me get home!” you 
demand. 

At least, that’s what you meant to say. But instead of words, flames come 
roaring out of your mouth. 

In seconds, the only man who could have helped you is extra-crispy! 

“Oh, no!” you gasp. More flames roar from your lips. 

There’s only one thing left to do. 

“Guest shot!” you try to cry. 

But since you can’t speak, you don’t vanish. Your despairing words once 
again lash out as flames, setting the laboratory on fire! 


Go to PAGE 58. 




74 

You glance up. A huge hammer is hurtling toward your head! 

You throw up your hands. But you know that won’t stop the falling 
hammer. You’re dead! 

Your skin suddenly starts to tingle. Sparks fly around your hair. Then a 
lightning bolt flies from your head. It smashes the hammer to bits! 

Your jaw drops. You stare at the pieces of wrecked hammer. “No way! 
This can’t be happening!” you blurt out. 

While you blink in disbelief, the wreckage fades away. You’re in a bare, 
gleaming room with a grid on the walls. 

You’ve seen this place before! It’s the Peril Parlor, where Y’s Guys 
practice their powers against holograms. 

And that means ... 

You glance down at yourself. Sure enough, you’re in the pink-and-blue 
uniform of Y’s Guys. And with that lightning bolt on your chest, you’d have 
to be ... 

“Yo, RAY-ge,” another pink-and-blue hero calls to you. “Professor Y 
wants to see us.” 

Professor Y! That’s the scientist you want to see! 


Meet the professor on PAGE 35 . 




75 

The hazzafrazza device looks much safer! you think. 

You stand under the floodlight on a set of copper and steel circles, one 
inside another. 

Tex Loudsnore starts pulling switches. The floodlight winks into life. 
Eerie, pulsing light shines down on you. 

All of a sudden, you feel very strange. It’s as if your body is stretching. 
Hey! This is sort of how you felt when the comics rack was spinning! Are you 
on your way home? 

The lab fades away. But you can still see Tex Loudsnore dancing around, 
cackling. 

“I’m your worst enemy, Super-Doofus!” he shouts. “Did you really think I 
was going to help you? The hazzafrazza device is a matter transmitter. And I 
set it for the center of the star Vega!” 

You try to scream, but no sound comes out. The lab is gone. A brilliant 
glow surrounds you. The glow gets brighter and brighter — not to mention 
hotter and hotter. 

Too bad. But look on the bright side. At least you got to be a real star in 

THE END! 



76 

“Hey!” you shout, flying straight at the store owner’s face. The closer you 
come, the bigger his face seems to get. 

In fact, the closer you come, the bigger the whole guy looks. 

Oh, no! 

You escaped from the comic, but something went terribly wrong. You’re 
still the size of a comics drawing! You’re barely two inches tall! 

A shadow falls over you. It’s the store guy’s hand, whipping down to swat 
you! 

Maybe he thinks you’re just another bug. Or maybe he knows exactly 
what you are, and he doesn’t want you to escape. 


Or maybe — 
SPLAT! 


THE END 



77 

You shake a fist under Milo’s nose. “Okay, Milo, it’s over!” you yell. “Let 
us all go — or you’ll be sorry!” 

Milo just laughs! “No, you’ll be sorry! Don’t you know I’m a mutant? I 
can change into any kind of creature I want to be.” He gives you an evil 
smile. “Here’s one I call — the Glob!” 

The chest you’re sitting on starts to wobble like Jell-O. You gasp as 
Milo’s skin turns transparent. 

Then he dribbles bonelessly out of his clothes! 

Cammie and Jack leap back, screaming. 

You try to jump, too. But Milo’s new form oozes around your legs. He’s 
not just gooey, he’s gluey. You can’t get free of Milo’s slimy self! 

He’s up to your knees ... your hips ... now you’re almost completely 
covered by the Glob. 

Desperately, you try to peel Milo’s glob-form off yourself. “HELP!” you 
try to shriek. But your air is cut off. 

You look at your arm. Your flesh is beginning to blur. 

Milo is absorbing you! 

Too bad. You looooze this time! 


THE END 



78 

Heart beating, you push past your friends — and into darkness. There’s 
not much room. You’re hemmed in tight. But you can see a light up ahead. 

You pay attention to nothing else, working toward it. The light becomes 
dazzling. Blindly, you shove your way forward, feeling squashed and 
breathless. 

You can’t move! Are you trapped? 

With a desperate wriggle, you force yourself a few inches forward. 

Then, like a cork popping out of a bottle, you’re through! 

You tumble flat on your face. Rough concrete scratches against your 
cheek. You feel sun on your back. You’re free! 

Scrambling to your feet, you dash along a back alley and out into the 
street. “Help!” you yell. “Kidnapping! Monsters!” 

Passersby on the street turn around. You gape in horror. 

These people have skin like dark green leather. They have giant, 
honeycombed eyes. Like insects. And they don’t talk. 

They buzz! 


Buzz on to PAGE 16. 




79 

Russell almost bursts into applause when you catch your ankle. “You’re 
just the person we need!” he cries. He turns to Bob. “Quick, get the others. 
We’ll be leaving right away!” 

Leaving? You were hoping you could stay at their camp. Somehow, it 
sounds safer than the rest of the maze. 

And another thing. “Why am I just the person you need?” you ask 
suspiciously. 

“Because of your size,” Russell answers. “Everybody in our group is too 
big.” 

A shiver runs down your spine. “Too big for what?” you want to know. 

Russell looks one way, then the other. He almost seems afraid he’ll be 
overheard. “We think we’ve found a way out of here!” he whispers. “But it 
will only work for a little person!” 


Turn to PAGE 5.

By sheer luck, you grab hold of the waiting hands. The boy pulls you out 
of the way — just in time. You look down at the lion-bull creature’s furious 
eyes. 

“Missed me!” you shout. 

The creature roars as you swing down off the wall. A second later, the 
plywood wall seems to explode! 

You duck as pieces of heavy wood framing fly past. What a mess! A pile 
of wreckage covers the lion-bull creature. It must have rammed down the wall 
and crashed into the next one! 

“Help!” a voice cries. 

You turn to your rescuer — to find him pinned under a pile of wreckage! 

Pull him loose on PAGE 85. 




81 

There’s something vibrating on your back. You crane to see over your 
shoulder. 

Wow! You’ve got wings! Giant, shimmering insect wings! 

You’re so astonished, you freeze. That includes your wings, which stop 
beating. Instantly, you drop about four feet. 

Lucky for you! A blast of energy sizzles right over your head. The blast- 
bolt! It explodes where you should have been. 

Your wings start to buzz again. You notice now that your body is encased 
in some kind of sparkling brown armor. 

Excellent! Your new “guest shot” has turned you into the star of the comic 
— Ballistic Bug! 

You zip around, ducking Dr. Doof’s blast-bolts. Then you realize: You 
can fight back! You’ve got other superpowers besides your insect wings. 

You’d like to try out your Insecto-Electric Hornet’s Sting. But you’re 
pretty far away from Dr. Doof. 

Should you try a blast from where you are? Or should you close in so 
your aim will be better? 

Turn to PAGE 56 for long-range sharpshooting. 

Turn to PAGE 92 to make it up close and personal! 





82 

For the first time since touching that comic rack, you feel a little hope. 
“Could you really get me back home?” 

Loudsnore rubs his chin. “Well, I need to run some tests to see if your 
atomic composition is different from ours. And then there’s the effect of the 
transuniversal phlogiston....” 

You don’t understand a word the mad scientist is saying. But you’re eager 
to help. “Just tell me what to do,” you cry. 

Loudsnore points to a big metal box. “Climb in there.” 

In there ? Maybe it’s your imagination, but the box looks like a big coffin. 
Is Loudsnore really trying to help you? Or is he trying to destroy you? 

“Isn’t there some other way you could make these tests?” you ask 
nervously. 

Loudsnore shrugs. “We could try the hazzafrazza device,” he says. He 
points to something that looks like a huge floodlight, dangling from the 
ceiling. “But I won’t get as good a reading.” 


Do you want to get into the coffin ? Turn to PAGE 130 .

83 

“Look, Doc,” you croak. “I’m sorry, okay?” Then you get a bright idea. 
“I’m in so many different series — I, uh, get mixed up sometimes about 
which script is which.” 

Dr. Doof scowls. “Sure, rub it in about how popular you are. I don’t know 
what all those fans see in you, with those stupid antennas sticking out of your 
helmet. Anybody with any brains could see I’ve got a cooler costume!” 

There’s one good thing about this weird situation. Dr. Doof seems like a 
reasonable guy — sort of. Once he calms down, you should be able to talk to 
him! 

Doof gives you one more shake, then sighs. “Well, we’ve got a job to do 
— unless you want to call a break.”

Whoa! Milo must have read your mind. And changed himself into your 
worst nightmare! 

His new body heaves and wobbles. He stares down at you through King 
Jellyjam’s gooshy yellow eyes. 

“Well?” he asks in a deep, gurgling voice. “What do you think? Am I 
scary enough?” 

You gag. You’d almost forgotten that King Jellyjam had disgusting bad 
breath. But Milo got it down perfectly. 

Your teeth are chattering so badly, you can’t answer right away. But that 
gives you a chance to think. 

Is Milo playing with you? Does he just want you to admit you’re scared 
before he does you in? 

On the other hand, Milo is in an unfamiliar body now. Maybe he doesn’t 
know how it works yet. Maybe you should try to beat him! 


If you admit that you’re scared, turn to PAGE 32 . 

If you want to go up against Milo, turn to PAGE 14 . 





85 

The good news is that the pile of stuff on top of your new friend isn’t as 
large as the mound that buried the lion-bull creature. 

You start tossing aside the pieces of wreckage. It isn’t easy. The wooden 
beams that held up the walls are thicker than your arms. Big chunks of wood 
lie under smaller ones. You quickly learn this stuff can get heavy! 

“What’s your name?” you puff as you kick a ten-foot beam off to one 
side. 

“I’m Charlie,” the trapped boy replies. “There’s a bunch of us down here. 
If you meet my friends, tell them what happened to me. But get out of here,” 
Charlie begs. “Save yourself while you can!” 

“No!” you shout. “I’m going to help you, and that’s final!” 

Work your way to PAGE 121 . 




86 

You laugh to yourself as you run through the maze. Frankenstein may be 
strong, but he’s so slow ! How did he ever catch people in the movies? 

The creature’s cries get even fainter as you pound along. Finally, at the 
end of a long hall, you stop to catch your breath. 

But you’ve only rested for a moment when a familiar shadow appears 
against the wall. A second later, Frankenstein comes staggering down the hall. 
His clawlike hands grope for you. 

“NYAAAAARRRRRRGH!” the creature cries. 

The scent of decaying meat fills your nose. 

He may be slow, but he’s still plenty scary. Shuddering, you dodge 
through the first doorway you see. Dashing down a new hall, you quickly 
outrun Frankenstein’s staggering steps. 

“Man!” you mutter. “That was too close! How did he catch up to me so 
quickly?” 

Then you get it. Of course. The creature lives in the maze\ It knows all the 
shortcuts! 


Run to PAGE 71.

You pound against the trick panel. It doesn’t budge! “Jack! Cammie!” you 
yell. “What’s going on?” 

They shout back, “We’ve never seen a wall like that before.” 

In spite of everything you do, the wooden panel stays stuck. 

“Just keep going,” Cammie calls to you. “Sooner or later, the maze must 
come together again.” 

You go through the nearest door and into the hallway beyond, shouting to 
your friends. But after a few turns, their voices sound farther away. And then 
you can’t hear them at all. 

Then you hit another big room. It’s different from anything else you’ve 
seen in the maze. The floor is covered by a puddle, yards wide. There’s just a 
little bit of dry space by the walls. “What is that stuff?” you mutter. It looks 
like black ink! 

Hearing your name called, you look up. There’s a doorway at the other 
side of the room. And there are Jack and Cammie! 

“Come on!” Jack cries. “Let’s get out of here!” 

You could walk through the gloppy puddle. Or maybe you should try to 
edge around it, hugging the walls. 


If you walk straight through, go to PAGE 21 . 
If you try going around, turn to PAGE 28 . 



88 

The footsteps get louder. Louder. 

And then one of Loudsnore’s horrible creations stomps in. It’s a dinosaur¬ 
like creature made of metal and plastic. 

And it looks a lot like your friend Wally. 

Loudsnore points at you. “Destroy this monster!” he orders the new 
creature. “But don’t hurt me.” 

“Don’t listen to him, Wally!” you shout. “He doesn’t really control you.” 

“Huh?” Wally’s glowing eyes look confused. “Hey! I’m not doing what 
he said. I guess he doesn’t control me.” 

You grin. “So, where were we?” you ask Loudsnore. “Oh, yes. You were 
giving me back my Super-Doer body — and de-monsterfying my friend, too.” 

Holding Loudsnore by the collar of his lab coat, you dangle him from 
your giant hand. 

“All right!” screams Loudsnore, clinging desperately to your fingers. “I’ll 
turn you both back!” 


Now he’s talking! Turn to PAGE 99 . 




89 

“Okay,” you tell yourself. “So I’m being followed through a dark maze. I 
should look on the bright side. Maybe whoever it is can show me the way out 
of here.” 

You turn back on your trail. As you do, you notice a nasty smell in the air. 
It reminds you of the time your uncle Mel left the bag of garbage in the 
kitchen when the family went on a two-week vacation. And it seems to be 
getting stronger. 

Uh-oh. 

You pop around a corner and into a room. Light pours through a second 
doorway. It throws a moving shadow on the wall. 

Maybe it’s Milo, or whatever the owner’s real name is. 

Then the figure arrives in the doorway. 

It’s not Milo. 

This guy is tall. And he doesn’t have a face like a rotten pumpkin. 

His skin is greenish-gray, like moldy cheese. Puckered scars run up his 
cheeks. A pair of big, metal bolts stick out of his neck. 

It’s impossible — but he looks like Frankenstein! 

When he sees you, he snarls, “NYAARGH!” 


Turn to PAGE 115. 




90 

“Doc? Hey, Doc? Are you okay?” you shout into the hole in space. 

No answer. 

Taking a deep breath, you stick your head through the hole. 

You blink. You’re gazing at an everyday street — outside a very familiar 
comic shop. Dr. Doof is standing there, peering in the window. 

“What were you screaming about?” you demand. 

“This world is so different,” Dr. Doof replies. His voice shakes. 

You realize he’s used to the flat, bright universe of the comics. “Yeah,” 
you reply. “I guess the colors seem pretty dull.” 

“It’s a drab world,” Dr. Doof agrees. “But a whole new world for me to 
conquer!” 

Uh-oh! Hurry to PAGE 42 . 




91 

Dr. Doof spins you over his head like a baseball batter doing warm-ups. 
“Whoa! Yow!” you screech as you fly around in circles. 

“Oh, good. That’s good,” Doof compliments you. 

“I’m not faking it!” you try to yell. But you’re so dizzy, you can’t get the 
words out. 

Then Dr. Doof hurls you away! 

“Aiiiiieeeee!” you yell. You’re hurtling straight at a brick wall. Headfirst! 

“Tuck and roll, bug-brain!” Doof howls. “You’ll break your neck!” 

If you were a trained comic-book professional, you’d know what to do. 
But since you aren’t, you don’t... and this is 

THE (CRUNCH!) END! 




92 

You dodge two more blasts from Dr. Doof, then zoom into a dive- 
bombing attack. 

Your Insecto-Electric Hornet’s Sting is built into your helmet’s antenna. 
The charge builds up all through your body. When you’re almost on top of Dr. 
Doof, you let it go. 

FZZT! A bolt of green energy leaps out of the antenna. It slams into your 
enemy’s chest, knocking him flat. 

“Hah!” you cry. You do a triumphant loop-the-loop in the air. “Take that, 
Doof!” 

Zoom to PAGE 55. 




93 


“Please,” you beg. “I need help. My friends are trapped —” 

Still shrieking, the bug-people start backing away. 

“Noooo!” you shout. You run after them. But they jump like huge crickets 
— twenty feet at a leap! In a couple of blocks, the bug-people leave you far 
behind. 

But one of them can’t jump away. He — or it — is trapped under an 
overturned cart. It looks like a rolling hot-dog stand, except the franks are 
wriggling wormlike things. 

You lean over the trapped alien. “Listen to me —” you begin. 

The bug-person flops back. It’s fainted! 

Clearly, you’re not going to get any help here. You’ll have to go back to 
the basement and rescue your friends yourself. 

But — how do you get back? How can you find the alley where you 
arrived on this world? As you gaze around, you realize that all the buildings 
are identical. Hivelike. 

It seems you’re stuck on this strange world ... a world where you ’re the 
monster. 

Oh, well. Don’t bug out! 


THE END 



94 

Ker-WHAM! You hit the wall with a tremendous crash — and keep on 
going! At least your cape is off your head now. 

Bang! Crash! You smash your way through other rooms in the building. 
But your superskin isn’t even scratched. Amazing! 

You thump through one more wall before you come to a stop. Time for a 
little payback! You rocket out through the series of holes you already made in 
the walls. 

Quick as a flash, you zoom back to the Wally-monster. POW! BOP! 
BIFF! You unleash your Power-Punch on Wally. 

“Hey! Ow! No fair!” Wally whines. “It’s not my fault. I didn’t want to be 
a monster. Tex Loudsnore turned me into one!” 

“Tex Loudsnore?” you repeat. Hmm. Not only is he the top villain in 
Super-Doer comics, he’s also a mad scientist. 

Just the guy you need! 


Move on to PAGE 57. 




95 

You decide to try for Dr. Doof’s help. After all, he doesn’t seem like a bad 
guy, once you get to know him. 

“Look, Doc,” you whisper. “I have a big problem. I don’t really belong 
here.” 

You explain about the comic shop and what happened to you. Dr. Doof 
listens without saying a word. 

You wish he’d take off those goggles and the metal mask. It would be nice 
to see the expression on his face. What if he thinks you’re just a total nutcase? 

But you keep on, until you’ve told the whole story. 

When you run out of words, Dr. Doof stands there silently for a long 
moment. 

“I always knew we were doing some sort of entertainment thing,” he 
finally mutters. “But... comic books!” He shakes his head. “I’m so 
embarrassed.” 

Embarrassed? 

“Forget about that,” you reply impatiently. “Is there any way to get out of 
here?” 

Dr. Doof thinks it over. 

At last, he declares, “Yes!” 


Well, what are you waiting for? Go to PAGE 13 ! 




96 

“Um, wait a second!” you cry. “I’m not sure —” 

But Tex Loudsnore has already started up the unconfrabulator. 

Trying to duck, you cry, “Guest sh —” 

A spear of brilliant blue light leaps from the device. It catches you right in 
the chest. Oh, the pain! You scream. 

Tex Loudsnore screams, too. “I told you to keep still! Now you’ve ruined 
everything. You’ll disintegrate. And /’// be stuck with Super-Doer again!” 

You gaze down in horror as your body begins to crumple in on itself. You 
can’t scream again, though. There’s nothing left to scream with! You stretch 
out your hands and watch them grow fainter and fainter, until they’re gone — 
and you’re gone! You’re nothing! 

It’s a shame. You always tried so hard to be cool. 

But now you’re a total zero! 


THE END 



97 

The monster with Wally’s face and voice reaches the top of the building. 
You get ready ... and jump! 

Whoops! You still need to get used to your new powers. You overshoot 
the building, speeding high into the sky! 

Spinning in midair, you charge back. The Wally-monster has reached the 
top of the unfinished building. Your fist goes back for your Power-Punch. 

This time you won’t miss! 

As you zoom down, the Wally-monster grabs a big steel girder that sticks 
up from the top of the building. Tearing the girder loose, he slings it over his 
shoulder. Like a club. Or ... 

Whack! Too late, you realize Wally was holding the girder like a baseball 
bat. And he’s using you as the ball! 

You grunt as the steel beam strikes you. Even with your superskin and 
maximuscles, the impact knocks the wind out of you. 

Wally’s swing also knocks you out of the construction site. Tumbling 
helplessly, you streak toward the horizon like a line drive! 


Swoosh to PAGE 48. 




98 

The colors fade away. Tex Loudsnore walks up and pinches you. 

“Ouch!” you yell. That hurt! You wish you were home in bed. You wish 
you were out of this comic. 

Of course, you could yell, “Guest shot!” 

But you don’t want to risk turning into an inkblot. Besides, your only 
hope of escaping from the Comic Books Universe is to get help from a mad 
scientist. And here’s one, right now. 

“Ah-hahahahaha!” Loudsnore gloats. “I’ve done it! You’ve lost your 
powers!” 

“I didn’t want them,” you reply. “Look, I’m not who you think I am. I’m 
really a kid in trouble. I need your help ...” 

As you explain how you wound up here, Tex Loudsnore’s eyes narrow. 
“Incredible!” he exclaims. “Impossible!” 

“That’s what I thought, until it happened,” you say. 

“It sounds like an interdimensional hyperflux,” Loudsnore muses. “Very 
interesting. Let me see what I can do.” 


Hear more from the mad scientist on PAGE 82 . 




99 

You set Tex Loudsnore down. He runs over to one of the lab tables. While 
he mixes chemicals, you keep an eagle eye on him. 

Wally slides up to you. “Do you trust Loudsnore?” he whispers. “I mean, 
he’s a villain — a bad guy!” 

“He’s also a mad scientist,” you point out. “You said that’s what we need 
to get home again.” 

“You trust him if you want to,” Wally says. “I’m out of here.” He takes a 
deep breath, then hollers, “Guest shot!” 

But instead of disappearing, Wally clutches at his throat and screams! He 
falls back against the wall. 

Then his body begins to melt all over the rock! 

Horrified, you step toward Wally. He frantically waves you away. His 
screams turn to bubbling moans. 

“The blot!” he coughs out. “I tried to jump once too often. I’m turning 
into an inkblot!” 

It’s too horrible. You squeeze your eyes shut. 

When you open them again, all that’s left of Wally is an enormous stain 
running down the wall and onto the floor! 


Yuck! Go to PAGE 106. 




100 

You hang back. You want to know more about this Doorway to Anywhere 
before you try it out. 

Dr. Doof steps forward. “Fascinating!” he exclaims, leaning into the black 
opening. 

Then, with a fearful cry, he’s sucked in! 

“Doc!” The cry bursts out of you. 

Dr. Doof clutches the edge of the black hole with one hand. He holds the 
other out to you. “Help me!” he shrieks. 

You don’t want to go near that hungry hole. 

But you’re supposed to be a hero, aren’t you? 

So you grab hold of Dr. Doof’s arm and pull. Your wings whine with the 
effort. 

The mad scientist suddenly pops out. He sprawls on the floor. 

The hole disappears with a sharp bang. 

And Dr. Doof grabs you by the throat, shouting, “Sucker!” 


Gulp! Go to page 119 . 




101 


“A werewolf!” you shriek. “Help! It’s got me!” 

Then you notice — your arm isn’t bleeding. It doesn’t even hurt. 

The creature has no teeth! 

Whining like an unhappy dog, the beast-man leaps away. 

“You were lucky,” Cammie says. “If that had turned out to be the 
Frenzied Flesh-eater ...” She shakes her head. 

“The maze creatures are all from Milo’s horror comic,” Jack explains. 
“Frankenstein, Menes, Wolfie —” 

“No way!” you burst out. “Those things don’t exist!” 

“You saw them,” Jack insists. “It’s Milo’s magic.” 

Jack and Cammie start walking again. You tag after them. “Wait! If Milo 
is magic, why didn’t he save his comic book? Why is he stuck running that 
dopey shop?” you demand. 

You turn a corner and crash into your two guides. They’re frozen in the 
doorway of a big room. It’s full of kids — and facing them is ... 

“Milo the Mutant!” you gasp. 

He hasn’t spotted you. Should you jump him? 

Or should you run? 


To tackle Milo, go to PAGE 123 . 

If you ’d rather get out of there, run off to PAGE 44 . 





102 

“School pal or not, you aren’t wrecking this building!” you cry. 

Flying down like an arrow, you aim for the Wally-monster’s nose. You 
already have your fist stuck out to deliver your Power-Punch. 

But when you arrive, Wally isn’t there! 

Desperately, you screech to a stop before you Power-Punch your way 
deep into the ground. 

You whirl to find the huge, prehistoric space-monster climbing up the 
building. Huge metal claws screech against the concrete walls as the Wally- 
monster pulls itself up. The noise is about ten times worse than the sound of 
fingernails on a blackboard. And since your super-ears are ten times keener 
than ordinary ears, it’s downright painful. 

“You’d better quit it, Wally,” you warn. “You’re beginning to annoy me!” 

Keep up the fight on PAGE 97 . 




103 

Your body feels as if giants have been using you for a game of tug-of-war. 
You’re sick and dizzy from the spinning. But you notice something is wrong. 
The world seems strangely flat. The colors are very bright. You peer up at an 
incredibly blue sky. 

Sky? Wait a minute! How did you get outside? 

An elbow jabs you. Someone steps on your foot. You aren’t just outside 

— you’re in a crowd. And what a crowd! You’re packed in so tightly, you can 
barely move. The person behind you is actually breathing down your neck. 

Could this be a parade? 

“What’s going on?” you ask. 

No one answers you. But a voice cries, “Here it comes!” 

A shadow falls across you. When you see what’s blocking the sunlight, 
your eyes grow big. It’s a gigantic tin can — with arms, legs, and a head. No 

— it’s a robot! 

“I don’t believe this!” you gasp in a strangled voice. 

You’d better believe it. That thing is as big as a skyscraper. And it’s 
striding straight for you! 


Go to PAGE 69. 




104 

“Guest shot!” you yell. 

When you open your eyes, you’re standing beside an office tower that’s 
still being built. The crowd is gone. The robot is gone. You’re all alone. 

“This is bizarre,” you mutter. 

A voice suddenly yells, “Heads up!” 

Of course, you look up. A falling brick hits you right between the eyes. 

And bounces off! 

You goggle in disbelief. That brick should have killed you. But it felt like 
a leaf being blown against you! 

You look down at yourself. Hey! You’ve grown up. You have all kinds of 
muscles. And you’re wearing what looks like purple long underwear with a 
big yellow S-D on the chest. 

You not only switched comics, you turned into Super-Doer! 

Cool! 

“I’ve got to find a steel bar!” you exclaim. “Can I really bend it with my 
bare hands?” 


Go looking on PAGE 26 . 




105 

Using your superspeedy scramble, you rush forward to grab the flying test 
tube. But this is another new power for you, and you don’t quite get it right. 

Tex Loudsnore’s test tube flashes past your fingers and shatters at your 
feet. Whatever is inside bubbles on the floor. Then you’re surrounded by a 
cloud of red and green smoke. 

“You’ll need more than a smoke bomb —” you start to say. 

But that’s all you can choke out. Your eyes burn. Your lungs feel on fire. 
Even your skin hurts! It’s stretched so tight, you’re afraid you’re going to 
burst like a balloon! 

You’re in pain. You’re also confused. Nothing is supposed to be able to 
hurt you. You’re Super-Doer! 

Right? 

Find out on PAGE 98. 




106 

Tex Loudsnore stares from you to the blot that Wally has become. “There 
must have been something wrong with that batch of creature creator,” he 
declares. “I’d better run some tests on you. We don’t want anything to go 
wrong when I change you back.” 

The mad scientist turns several weird instruments on you. He frowns. 

“My phenopticon is getting odd readings from you. My formula reacted very 
strangely with you.” 

“So?” you demand. 

Loudsnore licks his lips nervously. “Well, I can give you back your Super- 
Doer body. But to do the job, I’ll have to take your superpowers away!” 

“Well —” you start to say. 

“Trust me. I know what I’m doing,” Loudsnore assures you. He starts 
mixing ingredients. In about a second and a half, he has another test tube in 
his hand, ready to throw. 

Wait a second, you think. 

How do you know what he’s got in there? How do you know he’s not 
going to turn you into something even worse this time? 

If you trust Loudsnore, turn to PAGE 22 . 

If you don X trust Loudsnore, turn to PAGE 64 .

“We saw Milo last week,” Cammie remarks. “The werewolf was chasing 
us. Milo popped around the corner and stared at us. Then he shook his head, 
like he was annoyed. Til never make my comeback this way,’ he said. 
Remember, Jack?” 

Jack doesn’t reply. He’s staring over your shoulder. You turn to see a bug 
crawling up the plywood wall. A big bug. 

Jack grabs for it. And Cammie snarls at him. It’s a sound you’d expect 
from a wild dog, not from a kid. Jack and Cammie seem ready to fight. You 
notice how skinny they are. And dirty. And how long their fingernails have 
grown. 

Suddenly, Cammie seems to remember you’re there. “Look, you need 
help,” she tells you. “Why not come with us?” 

“Yeah, you can meet the other kids,” Jack adds. 

Your eyes widen. “You mean there are more of us down here?” 

Jack nods. “We help each other.” 

Getting help, even from strangers, sounds good to you. But then again, 
you’re not too far from that trick stairway. You might be able to find a way 
out on your own. 


If you go with Jack and Cammie, move on to PAGE 124 . 
If you turn them down and go on alone, go to PAGE 112 . 





108 

Everyone in the room is whooping and hollering to celebrate your victory. 
You peer down at the helpless former comic book host. He seems oddly calm. 

“Fine,” you yell over the noise. “We got him. Now what do we do with 
him?” 

“Make him let us go!” one of the kids yells. 

“Yeah,” Cammie cries. “Milo must know the way out of here.” 

But you find yourself thinking back to the speech Milo was making when 
you tackled him. He said he had a very serious reason for keeping the kids in 
the maze. 

What could it be? 

If you tell Milo to let everyone go, turn to PAGE 77 . 

If you ask Milo what he’s up to, turn to PAGE 40 . 





109 

You gulp. But their faces seem friendly. 

“Why don’t you come with us?” Cammie suggests, stepping up to you. 
“You’ll be just in time for dinner.” 

“That’s right,” Jack chimes in, taking your arm in a firm grip. You try to 
shake off his hand. 

You can’t get free. 

“Uh — what is there to eat down here?” you ask. 

“Oh, we just take whatever falls our way.” Cammie grins at you. You 
suddenly notice how big her teeth are. How pointed. 

Jack’s smile reveals the same big, sharp fangs. 

Hope you don’t have a sweet tooth. Because it doesn’t look as if you’ll be 
around for dessert! 


THE END 



110 

The trapdoor flies open more easily than you expected. You drop to your 
knees, eager to explore whatever is down there. 

But there’s no way down! No stairs. No ladder. Not even a rope to climb. 

Fog seeps up through the open trapdoor. As the misty wisps touch you, 
you shiver. You’ve never felt anything so cold! 

On instinct, you try to leap for the doorway. But it’s already too late. Your 
muscles won’t obey. They’re frozen! 

The fog is all around you now. A thin film of ice forms on your skin. 
Dimly, you notice Bob and another boy, peering through the doorway at you. 

“You were right, Bob. It was a trap,” the strange boy says. “That kid was 
just what we needed. Better a stranger should get hurt than one of us.” 

That’s all you hear. Then the icicles on your front half pull you off 
balance. You topple forward. Into the dark hole. 

SPLOOSH! You plunge into icy black water. A swift current whirls you 
away. What’s happening? you wonder foggily. 

Then you pass out. 


Wash up on PAGE 137 . 




111 

Tiny gray dots swirl around you. They land, covering your arms, your 
hands, your face. 

You try to brush the stuff away. It won’t come off! 

“Bugs!” Russell yells in horror. “They’re teeny, tiny bugsl” 

You feel a creepy-crawly sensation on your skin. Then it starts to sting — 
like millions of pin-pricks. You blink your eyes and hold your nose, trying to 
keeps the bugs away. But you feel suddenly weak. It’s as though these tiny 
things are sucking the juices right out of you! 

Alicia keels over, hitting the floor. She’s covered in gray gunk. She looks 
just like those piles of mold you passed in the other rooms. 

You must look like one, too, you think as you fall. 

And soon, that’s all you’ll be.... 

THE END 



112 

You want to get out of this maze now. Besides, Cammie and Jack are too 
weird for you. “Thanks, but I’d like to see how I get along on my own,” you 
tell them. You fake a smile. “Maybe I’ll see you later.” 

You hurry out of the room. 

Behind you, they start snarling at each other again. “You let that kid get 
away!” Jack’s voice echoes through the maze. 

“Oh, right,” Cammie answers. “It was you and your bug-eating! You 
should never do that in front of newcomers.” 

“Speaking of bugs —” Jack’s voice stops. But you hear a loud CRUNCH! 
as if he’s biting into something. 

Something with a hard shell. 

“Come on!” Cammie orders. 

Then you hear their footsteps. Coming your way! 

Do you run? If so, turn to PAGE 50 . 

Or should you try to hide? Turn to PAGE 125 . 





113 

When your eyes clear, you find Milo standing over you. He’s changed 
back to his usual ugly but not-so-scary self. A big grin stretches across his 
warty face. 

“You d-didn’t kill me?” you stammer. 

Your voice! It comes out as a gurgling roar. 

“Kill you?” Milo laughs. “Kid, you’re my gold mine! I’m going to make 
you my partner — my star!” 

“What?” You sit up — and bob squishily for a moment. What’s going on? 
Why is Milo so far below? 

You wipe a drop of sweat off your forehead. Eek! Where did that snail 
come from? And when did your hand turn purple? 

Oh, no. Milo has mutated you into King Jellyjam! 

“We’ll make tons of money!” Milo gloats. He waves a hand in front of his 
face. “Of course, some of it will have to go on breath mints and deodorant for 
you.” 

Your show is a big hit. You start with TV, but soon you’re starring in 
movies. Huge crowds turn out whenever you make a personal appearance. 
They love you! 

But the real moneymakers are your El Grosso Snail Farms. Where do you 
get the snails? 

No sweat! 


THE END 



114 

You catch the test tube, but the top pops off. POOF! The world disappears 
in a puff of purple smoke. Your skin begins to crawl. Your bones ache. 

Then the cloud disappears. No — it’s just down around your middle. The 
lab seems smaller. 

No, wait. It’s you. You’re growing. 

The purple cloud is farther down, and the roof of the cave is coming 
closer and closer to your head. 

That’s ninety feet high! you think. That makes me — 

Your thoughts get jumbled as your head bumps against the ceiling of the 
cave. You close your eyes, bracing yourself to get squashed against the roof. 
But it doesn’t happen. 

You’ve stopped growing! 

Looking down at yourself, you realize you’ve changed. Your skin is green 
and scaly. And you have a thick tail. 

Gulping, you run your fingers over your face. Oh, no! Bulging eyes, 
scales, sharp teeth, tusks — 

Tusks? 

What kind of monster has Tex Loudsnore turned you into? 


Learn the worst on PAGE 34. 




115 

For a moment, you can’t tear your eyes away from Frankenstein. But 
when he lurches toward you, you leap away. You dash down a hallway. The 
creature’s snarling cry echoes behind you. 

As you race through the next doorway, you scrape against the rough 
plywood. Your jacket tugs you back when you take the next step. It’s caught 
on a bunch of splinters! 

You try to pull loose, but you can’t get free! And here come the monster’s 
scraping footsteps! Desperately, you wrestle out of the coat and keep running. 

You turn left. Then right. Then right again. After a few moments, the 
creature’s snarls become fainter. It sounds as if you’re losing him! 

Should you keep running? Or, now that he can’t see you, should you try 
sneaking away from the creature? 

One thing’s for sure — you’ve got to find the way out of this maze. Fast! 


If you run, turn to PAGE 86 . 

If you sneak away, turn to PAGE 65 .

“Here, buggie-buggie,” you whisper. You’re worried. This is an important 
moment in comic book history. If one detail isn’t right, there might be no 
Ballistic Bug. 

The glowing bug scuttles toward you. You stick out your arm ... 

Wow! Look at the size of that stinger! 

The bug buzzes around your arm. Then it strikes! 

“Yeeee-OW!” you yell. It’s a lot more painful than Peewee Parkbench 
made it look in the comic. 

In fact, it feels as if someone injected molten lava into your veins.... 

You collapse, gasping. You can’t feel your hands or feet anymore. 
Something has definitely gone wrong. 

Remember how you worried about one detail being different at this 
moment in history? Well, there was. You were here, not Peewee Parkbench. 

And it seems you’re allergic to mutant bug-bites. 

Fatally allergic. 

The world starts to vanish in a red haze. 

Maybe you should start looking for a mad doctor .... 


THE END

“See, it’s hard to guess time. We can’t tell whether it’s day or night in 
Milo’s maze,” Cammie explains. 

“Milo’s maze?” you repeat. “So the guy in the comic shop is called Milo? 
Like the guy from The Cellar of Scary Stories ?” 

“He is the guy from The Cellar of Scary Stories,” Cammie replies. “Or he 
was. The comic was canceled years ago.” 

“But if there’s no more comic, how could — wait a minute!” you yell. 
“Comic characters aren’t real! This is impossible!” 

Jack just shivers. “With Milo, anything is possible. He blames kids for not 
buying enough of his comic books.” 

“Is that why he trapped us down here?” you ask. 

Jack shakes his shaggy head. “We aren’t sure. Sometimes we catch him 
spying on us. We think maybe he’s trying to scare us.” 

“Trying?” you sputter. “I’m scared to death!” 


Shudder along to PAGE 107 .

“I’ll go first,” Cammie declares. She leans into the glowing mirror. Then 
she jumps back. “Whoa!” 

A face has appeared in the mirror. Milo the Mutant! 

“What are you doing in my room?” he yells. 

“We’ve got to get away!” Cammie cries. She turns to you. “What was 
beyond your doorway?” 

“Just a room,” you reply, “full of boxes of comics.” 

“I didn’t get a chance to look through my door,” Jack complains. “You 
called me in here.” 

You hurry to Jack’s doorway — and gasp. Stretching up to a trapdoor in 
the ceiling is a ladder. It’s made of dark wood, carved into twisting shapes — 
snakes, dragons, weirder creatures. It’s beautiful — but strange. 

You step toward the ladder. It suddenly begins to glow red. Wind swirls 
around it, flinging you back. The glowing form shrinks down until it’s barely 
a foot tall! 

Milo’s laughter echoes from the mirror next door. “That takes care of the 
magic ladder!” he cries. “Now I’ll start the spell to take care of you!” 

You gawk helplessly at the trapdoor in the ceiling. If only you could get 
up there. So near, and yet so far! 


Move it to PAGE 52. 




119 

Your wings buzz frantically, but you can’t break Dr. Doof’s choke hold! 

“Now I’ve got you, insect!” he roars, shaking you. 

You try every trick you ever read in a Ballistic Bug comic book. But 
nothing weakens the grip of those steel-clad fingers. You’re about half a 
breath short of choking as Dr. Doof climbs to his feet. 

But then the evil doctor hauls you close and whispers, “Have you gone 
completely batty, bug? That sting-bolt of yours wasn’t in the script!” 

Script? 

What’s Dr. Doof talking about? Find out on PAGE 38 . 




120 

You tag along with the tour group, thinking hard. You don’t even glance 
at the huge, powerful machines in the nuclear plant. Instead, you keep your 
eyes peeled for a glowing insect. That’s the creature that will bite Peewee 
Parkbench and give him his amazing insect powers. 

At last, you spot the bug. 

Whoa, is that thing ugly! It’s obviously some kind of nuclear mutant. It 
looks like an overgrown roach — with a huge, nasty stinger. You couldn’t 
really see that part in the comics. All the picture showed was a line in the air 
and the word BZZZZZl In the next picture, Peewee Parkbench yelled, “Ow!” 

Now you can see why. 

Do you really want to let that ugly thing sting you? 

True, you want to make sure comics history doesn’t change. But you also 
want to get back home. Maybe you should just jump to some other comic and 
keep searching for a mad scientist. 

Better decide fast. The bug is coming your way!

If you let the bad bug bite, turn to PAGE 116 . 





121 

You roll, throw, or shove battered pieces of wood away. Your arms are 
tired and burning from all this work. And you still face the hardest job of all. 
Charlie is pinned under a whole sheet of plywood. How are you going to lift a 
slab of wood twice as tall as you are — and three times as wide? 

“I’ll try to push from down here,” Charlie says. 

“And I’ll — oof! — pull,” you say. 

You pull until you’re red in the face and your arms are shaking. But the 
wooden slab hasn’t moved an inch! 

Could it be stuck on something? You glance around — and notice a heavy 
bull’s hoof resting on one corner of the slab. 

Your eyes travel slowly up the bull’s leg. Past the heavy body. The eagle’s 
wings. And on to the lion’s head. 

The beast stares down at you. You’ve never heard of lions laughing 
before, but that’s what this one seems to be doing. 

Slowly, the beast paces forward. And you have nowhere to run, no walls 
to hide behind. 

Oh, well. It seems your luck was bad after all. But you were right about 
one thing. 

You stayed to help — and that was final! 


THE END 



122 

You swallow hard. “Go for it!” you command. 

Tex Loudsnore hits a button. Streaks of blue lightning crawl along the 
barrel of the unconfrabulator. You close your eyes and stand absolutely still. 

Hey! You thought that having your atoms destroyed would hurt. Instead, 
you feel light. Incredibly light. As if the slightest breath could blow you away. 

You open your eyes to discover that Tex Loudsnore’s laboratory is gone! 
Instead, you’re floating among tiny, bright spots that look like stars. They 
glow brilliantly, red, yellow, blue, against the solid blackness. 

Giggling, you swoop upward. Multicolored stars twirl around you. Higher 
and higher you go, until the colored stars blur into a bright, harsh glare. 

You don’t feel weightless now, but heavy. Clumsy. 

Staggering around, you grab on to ... a door handle! You stumble into a 
tiny store packed with vacuum cleaners. An old man with long gray hair grabs 
you by the arm as you almost fall. 

“You okay, kid?” he asks. 


Stagger over to PAGE 45 . 




123 


Milo is ranting as you, Cammie, and Jack sneak up on him. 

“I didn’t do all this for fun, you know!” the pumpkin-faced little man 
yells. “You’re all down here for a very serious reason, and I want you to — 
YOW!” 

Milo yells in shock as the three of you pile onto him. For a little guy, he’s 
surprisingly strong. Maybe he gets his muscles from shifting around those 
huge boxes of comic books. 

But, strong or not, there are more of you than there are of him. 

It’s a short, sharp battle. But in the end Jack has Milo’s right arm, 
Cammie holds down his left, and you’re perched on his chest. 

“You did it!” one of the captive kids cheers. “You got Milo!” 

Proceed in triumph to PAGE 108 . 




124 

These dirty, weird-looking kids know more about this maze than you do. 
“I’ll go with you guys,” you decide. 

“Fine,” Cammie replies. “Follow us.” 

They lead you quickly through the maze. You’re more lost than ever now. 

They yank you back when you reach a doorway. Jack raises a finger to his 
lips — the “be quiet” sign. You don’t understand why. It sounds as if 
somebody is using a chain saw on the other side. 

But as you tiptoe through, you find the noise doesn’t come from a 
machine. It comes from a pile of bandages on the floor. 

No, wait. Those bandages are wrapped around a body. 

Eek! A mummy! 

And the mummy isn’t dead — it’s snoring! 

Jack steps right over the sleeping creature. So does Cammie. They both 
beckon to you. The mummy makes weird gargling noises as you go to step 
over it. You’re shaking so badly, your toe pokes the creature right in the side. 

The snores stop. Withered eyelids open. Dried-out eyes like black raisins 
glare up at you! 


Get out of there to PAGE 60 ! 




125 


I’m ahead of them, you think. And I’m good at hide-and-seek. 

On tiptoe, you sneak through the maze. At last, you find a little room with 
only one doorway. It’s hidden behind some old sheets of plywood. They’ll 
never find you here! 

But in just a few minutes, you hear an odd noise. It sounds like someone 
sniffling. Trying not to cry. 

As the sound gets louder, you realize it’s not someone sniffling, but 
someone sniffing ! 

A weird, humped shadow appears in the doorway. It looks like a dog, 
sniffing out a trail. No! It’s a shaggy-headed boy, crawling along with his 
nose on the floor. Jack! 

A chill trickles down your spine. 

A second later, Jack and Cammie block the door. 


Turn to PAGE 109. 




126 

You figure you should let Dr. Doof finish the scene. It’ll give him time to 
calm down. Then you’ll be able to talk to him quietly. 

You’re sure you’ll be able to convince him to help you! 

“Let’s go on with the fight, Doc,” you suggest. 

“Okay,” the villain says. “Since we already trashed the script, we’ll have 
to fake it. But make it look good. Rev up your wings.” 

You start your wings buzzing. Dr. Doof suddenly leaps back. 

“My grip!” he roars. “How did you break my grip?” 

I didn’t, you think. He let me go, the big phony! 

What a cheat these fight scenes are! 

You buzz around Dr. Doof. He shouts threats while zapping blast-bolts at 
you — and missing. 

“Okay. Get ready for the old A-233!” Doof whispers. 

What’s the old A-233? you wonder frantically. 

The next thing you know, Dr. Doof grabs you by the ankles! 


What is the old A-233? Find out on PAGE 91 ! 




127 

You roll, bounce — even tumble in a somersault. Then there’s nothing 
underneath you! 

You shoot past the end of the metal slide and slam into a plywood wall. 
Then you thud down onto a concrete floor. “Ooof!” you groan. That hurt! 

On your hands and knees, you try to climb back up the slide that used to 
be a stairway. But it’s too steep and slippery. You just slither to the bottom 
again. 

Trying to stay calm, you gaze around. You’re in a small, shadowy room. 

Its walls are made of plywood. An opening leads to a plywood hallway, lit by 
a single bulb. 

You walk down the hall. After a few yards, it turns. You find yourself in 
another little room. This one has three doorways. You choose the right-hand 
one — to find yet another hall. That one zigzags to two more rooms, then a 
four-way intersection of corridors. 

“What’s going on?” you mutter. “I feel like a rat in a maze!” 


Turn to PAGE 47. 




128 

You’ll go with Bob. After all, he saved you from the lion-bull-eagle 
monster. He knows what he’s doing. 

“Everybody for Bob’s route, raise your hand,” Russell calls. 

You raise your hand. So do Dan and Alicia. Bob’s shortcut wins! Russell 
seems annoyed, but he doesn’t say anything. 

As you file along Bob’s route, you notice that the walls of the maze are 
covered in gray gunk. It looks like mold. In some places there are piles of it 
on the floor. 

“Have you ever seen this stuff before?” Russell asks Bob. 

The other boy shakes his head. “No, and we shouldn’t take any chances 
with it. Nobody touch the walls.” 

The stuff has a sharp, peppery smell. Your nose twitches as you move into 
a room where it coats the walls thickly. 

It’s too much. You can’t help yourself. “AAAAAH-CHOOO!” 

Your sneeze blows a clump of the mold loose from the walls. It swirls 
around you in a gray cloud. 

But it doesn’t act like any cloud you’ve ever seen. Instead of spreading 
out, it gathers in, circling around you and your friends. 

Then the cloud breaks into five separate clouds. One for each of you! 


Hold your nose and turn to PAGE 111 . 




129 

Huge jaws snap hungrily just inches below your feet. But then you’re safe 
on the other side of the wall. The patchwork creature roars again. It clomps 
off to the right. 

You stare at the kid who helped you. He’s bigger than you are, and older. 

“Wh-who are you?” you babble. “What are you doing here?” 

He grins. “It’s a long story. To start with, my name is Bob.” 

You introduce yourself, but he’s not really listening. “That lion-thing 
knows its way through this maze. It’s going to find us if we stick around. 

What do you say we get out of here?” 

Sounds like a great idea to you. 

Bob starts leading you through the maze. “There’s more of us trapped 
down here,” he explains. “We’ve got a kind of camp set up.” 

He gives you a long stare. “I think everyone will be glad to see you,” he 
announces. “Very glad.” 


March along to PAGE 39 . 




130 

Nervously, you climb into the metal box. Tex Loudsnore slams the lid 
closed. 

You lie there in darkness. Suddenly, you’re surrounded by a blinding 
light, like a camera flash. Then Loudsnore opens the box and helps you out. 

“Your story seems to check out,” he admits. “According to my readings, 
your atoms don’t belong in this universe.” 

“Can you figure out a way to send me back?” you ask. 

Loudsnore’s smile is evil. “Maybe —just maybe! And if I do it right, I 
may get rid of Super-Doer forever! Every other time I kill him, he comes back 
to life later.” 

“How will you do it?” you ask, a little alarmed. 

“To escape from this dimension, every atom of you — and of Super-Doer 
— must be destroyed,” Loudsnore declares. 

Your teeth chatter as you repeat, “D-d-destroyed?” 

Loudsnore nods. “That will free you from this comic — and me from 
Super-Doer!” He grabs your arm. “Just stand here in front of the 
unconfrabulator — and don’t move!” 


To try this route home, go to PAGE 122 . 

To try to escape before your atoms get destroyed, go to PAGE 96 . 





131 


“I’m not going to hang around like an idiot!” you fume. 

You step through the opening. Now, which way did Bob go? 

There’s yet another hallway. At the far end is a room. 

As you scout around, you realize that this room is different. The walls are 
the same old plywood. But there’s a trapdoor in the middle of the concrete 
floor! 

Your heart beats faster. Could it be the way out? 

You’ve got to investigate! The door is made of wood, with a big metal 
handle. You grab hold and heave. 

Get on down to PAGE 110! 




132 

“Hey, lighten up,” you complain. “I mean, I told Wolfen-bean he would 
turn into an inkblot. The writing was on the wall!” 

Y’s Guys aren’t laughing. You try again. 

“Uh — how about if we change his name to Spot?” you suggest. 
Whoops. Bad joke. 

“Get that kid!” the Fighting Vegetable shrieks. 

Y’s Guys hurl themselves at you. 

As you sink under the attack, you think sadly, Why did I have to be such 
wise guy? 


THE END 



133 

You stretch and stretch. But you can’t grab your ankle in your hand. 

“Sorry, you fail the test,” Russell says. “You’ll have to go.” 

Go? This nerdy-looking guy wants you to face this dangerous maze 
alone? 

You’re furious! You argue, shout, then plead. But Bob and Russell won’t 
take you to their hideout. 

“Fine!” you yell at last. “I can make it on my own. I’ve done all right so 
far.” 

You stomp off. You’re so mad, you aren’t paying attention to where 
you’re going. And you’re making lots of noise. 

Still fuming, you step through a doorway and trip over something. It’s 
long, cool, and scaly. 

Oops! You just bumped into the snake-creature again! 


Stumble to PAGE 41. 




134 

The hairy hand of Professor Y points right at you! 

“Um, ah ..It’s not the smoothest answer. But it’s the best you can do 
when your mouth is dry with terror. 

But Professor Y’s hand swings past you to point at Stinky Stanley. “No!” 
the professor cries. “It’syou! No — wait!” 

He turns to Jean Greene. “Now my powers point to you!” 

Something very strange is going on.... 

The professor goes from one Y’s Guy to another. “And you! And you!” 
His voice drips with horror. “Great Googly Moogly! You’re all from outside 
this universe!” 

You stare at the other superheroes. Could this be true? Could they all be 
kids who were sucked into comics? 

“Death to the invaders!” Professor Y snarls. He flings deadly hair balls at 
all of you. You’ve seen these things in the comic — they can choke you to 
death! 


Turn to PAGE 53. 




135 

You might as well go for it. 

“Yes,” you answer boldly, “I could do better!” 

“Yeah, right,” Milo scoffs. “Okay, close your eyes and think of the 
scariest creature you can.” 

You close your eyes, remembering a horrifying creature from a book you 
read. A GOOSEBUMPS book. The creature — King Jellyjam — was a huge, 
quivering balloon of purple slime. Its watery yellow eyes peered over a blob 
of a nose running with white goo. It had big, rubbery lips that blubbered and 
burped. It smelled like dirty sweat socks filled with rotten fish — or worse! 

And its gross, gooey body was always sweating. Not just plain sweat. 

King Jellyjam sweated live snails! 

You open your eyes to tell Milo about the creature. 

Oh, no. This is really bad! 

Milo is changing — mutating. Into King Jellyjam! 


Shiver to PAGE 84. 




136 

The solid steel feels like Silly Putty under your fist! You keep pounding 
until you tear a hole through the door. 

Then you use both hands to rip an opening large enough to walk through. 
You step into the mad scientist’s laboratory. 

You recognize Tex Loudsnore easily from the comics. He’s tall, skinny, 
and he doesn’t have any hair. Instead, the top half of his head is made of a 
gleaming chrome dome. He’s Tex Loudsnore, the man with the pop-top head! 
Tex Loudsnore, villain and monster-maker! 

“Super-Doer!” he snarls. “I don’t know how you found me. But my latest 
invention can handle even you!” 

The mad scientist hefts a test tube in his hand. Then he throws it at you! 
Can you catch it? 

To find out, hold a twelve-inch ruler straight up, with your thumb and 
forefinger on the bottom at the one-inch mark. Open your fingers to let the 
ruler drop. Then catch it again. 

If you catch the ruler between the one-inch mark and the nine-inch mark, 
go to PAGE 114 . 

If you catch the ruler between the nine-inch mark and the twelve-inch 
mark, go to PAGE 105 . 


If you don’t catch the ruler at all... try again! 





137 

When you wake up again, the first thing you notice is that you’re really 
cold. 

The second thing you notice is that you’re lying on a metal table. 
Surrounded by people in white coats. 

You blink. “What’s up?” you ask. “Where am I?” 

“The kid’s alive,” a man cries. “It’s a medical miracle!” 

As it turns out, the people in white coats are scientists, studying the ice in 
Antarctica. Imagine their surprise when they found you — frozen into one of 
the icebergs. Alive! 

No one knows how you got all the way to Antarctica. Or how you stayed 
alive inside your ice coating. For the next two weeks, you’re poked and 
prodded by dozens of doctors. 

Finally, they give up and send you home. 

That’s when the newspapers and TV stations start calling. They all want 
the life story of the Icekid. 

And they offer you big bucks! 

Soon you have so much money you don’t know how to spend it all. Well, 
actually, you’ve got a few ideas. 

Starting with a trip to a comic book store....
