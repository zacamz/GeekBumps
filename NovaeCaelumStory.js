  `Page 0: Finding Life\n
  By Novae Caelum\n
  Continue to Page 1`,
  `Page 1: The air in your helmet is humid with your breath. You stand alone in the depressurized airlock of the landing pod, your mission commander's voice crackling in your ear. But you hardly hear her. You're about to take the first step any human has taken on a world outside of Sol System--Earth's home system.
  \n
  To look out the airlock porthole, go to page 3.
  To answer your radio, go to page 2.`,
  `Page 2: "Okay, you're clear for debarkation," Commander Wang says. Her voice is higher than normal, showing her own excitement. You all slept eighteen years in cold storage to get this far, and now you're here.
  \n
  To immediately open the outer hatch, go to page 4.
  To pressurize the airlock, go to page 5.`,
  `Page 3: The airlock's outer porthole is misted over, but you can see oranges and greens through the thick alumiglass. This planet has life, you think. This planet has life.
  \n
  Continue to page 2.`,
  `Page 4: You yank the ships hatch open, but in your excitement you forgot to pressurize the airlock!  As door unlocks a huge rush of air rushes in the opening, throwing you against the wall and smashing your visor.  Your vision goes dark.`,
  `Page 5: You press the button to pressurize the airlock, feeling the high pressure of this world squeeze your suit tightly.   You key open the airlock with your polymer mesh suit gloves--and thank goodness Earth was able to invent thinner suits so you could 3D print them before landing. You don't want to miss anything this world will have to offer.  The airlock hatch opens.
  \n
  To look around, go to page 6.
  To step out, go to page 7.`,
  `Page 6: You just stand and stare before you step outside. The sky is the green of copper patina. The ground is shades of bronze, dusty between upthrust, metallic plants. There's a breeze--you feel its tug at your suit pants.
  \n
  Continue to page 7.`,
  `Page 7: You step out, down the ramp, and your boots crunch into chalky gravel. Chills run up your arms and down your back and you turn as wide a circle as you can without the view being blocked by the bulky gray landing pod, with its white Earth Forward corporate logos.
  \n
  It's a sweeping panorama of solitude. Of rocky hills and metallic foliage--not greenery, because it's not green. You've seen pictures from the probes that Earth Forward sent before they sent you and your crew. But this--even through your transparent, near 360 degree face plate, this doesn't compare to the pictures. Or even the VR.
  \n
  You feel the inclination to take off your helmet and run!  You want to pull off your gloves and shove your fingers into the ground.
  \n
  To take off your helmet, go to page 9.
  To keep your helmet on, go to page 8.`,
  `Page 8: You keep your helmet nice and secure. The air is toxic, and too hot for humans. Even in your suit, you'll only be able to walk outside the pod for three hours before your suit's environmental systems need to recharge from the extreme stress of the heat. If you touched the ground, it would burn your fingers.
  \n
  "What's your status?" Commander Wang asks. She can see everything you're seeing, of course. You're broadcasting to your crew of five, and the broadcast will be bundled and sent in a data stream back to Earth. It will take five years to get there, but it will get there. And everyone will see this moment. Your first moment. Everyone's first moment on this world.
  \n
  To answer, go to page 10.
  To continue looking around, go to page 11.`,
  `Page 9: You unlock the clasp of your helmet and you start to run forward in excitement!  Suddenly the scorching hot air rushes into your face and you've realized your mistake.  You immediately start coughing as you breathe in the toxic air. You fall to the ground and take your last breath.`,
  `Page 10: You open your mouth to answer, your mind grasping for something routine for this routine question, because otherwise, you have no words. But something shining to your right catches your attention.
  \n
  Continue to page 11.`,
  `Page 11: You squint, and the focusing mechanism in your helmet's HUD zooms in, growing pixelated a moment until the image resolves into...a bulky, metal shape.
  \n
  What the..." You turn to fully face the shape and zoom in further. Your HUD is almost at its image range. But you can see the straight lines, rectangular angles, of something that is definitely not natural. The image resolves into the best clarity your HUD can give, and what you first thought was a discoloration resolves into silvery-red letters. Sharp and angular. A script no human has ever seen.
  \n
  Your earpiece clogs with the swearing of your crew. But you hardly hear them, as your heart is pounding again, this time with a different rhythm. Should you be afraid? Maybe. But at that moment, you feel completely alive.
  \n
  Whatever that craft or structure is, it hasn't been here long.
  \n
  Continue to page 12.`,
  `Page 12: "Why didn't we see it from orbit? Or on the drone cams?" the crew engineer asks. "Seriously, how did we miss that?"
  \n
  The wind continues to blow dust and dirt from the ship--and it's definitely a ship, as you can now see the backwards-jutting spikes of what must be engines. From what scale you can determine, the ship isn't large. Maybe three or four times the size of your pod, certainly not as big as your ship in orbit.
  \n
  "Our pod's landing," you say, as you start to walk toward the craft.
  \n
  To run over to the ship, go to page 13.
  To mark the ship's location on your HUD, go to page 14.`,
  `Page 13: To start jogging towards the ship, but the rocky terrain makes it difficult.  You stumble over a rock and scratch a hole in the sleeve of your suit!  Your suit's warning system immediately starts blaring in your ears. "WARNING, Environment systems destabilized! Return to the ship immediately!  You curse as you head back to the ship, now they'll send Jeff instead of you for this momentus discovery...`,
  `Page 14: You zoom out your HUD, but mark the ship's location in the distance. It wouldn't do to trip on a rock and rupture your suit before you get there. "We stirred up the dirt when we landed. The wind is doing the rest." But it hadn't been fully covered, had it? Just a surface layer. How many days or weeks did it take on this dusty plain for a surface layer to accumulate?
  \n
  How long had whoever had landed--or crashed--that ship been here?
  \n
  Who were they?
  \n
  Not humans, certainly.
  \n
  "Hey! Where are you going?" Commander Wang yells. "Get back in the pod. We'll send out drones to investigate. I don't want you going near that ship."
  \n
  To go back to the pod, go to page 15.
  To continue anyways towards the ship, go to page 18.`,
  `Page 15: You respond, "Roger that" in your comms dejectedly.
  \n
  All the work was planned for night, when the heat wasn't as intense and you could send down and set up the habitat pods with more time in between suit recharges.
  You head back to the ship. 
  \n
  Continue to page 16.`,
  `Page 16: You came here to find life, because Earth's probes detected life on this world. And there is life--the native metallic plants, the teeming micro-organisms in the oceans and ponds, and the scurrying macro-organisms that typically come out at night.
  \n
  Back on the ship you recharge your suit and rest until the sun sets.  
  \n
  Once the sun is down you begin documenting the incredible sights as the flora of the planet suddenly glow in the darkness.
  \n
  To go back outside, go to page 17.
  To begin your live-stream to Earth, go to page 20.`,
  `Page 17: You get back into your suit and head back out of the spacecraft.  You walk towards one of the small metallic-looking plants to inspect it further.
  \n
  As you get closer, you hear a clink from behind you.  You struggle to turn around in you clunky suit, but you only catch a glimpse of a long metallic talon as it pierces your chest.
  \n
  As your vision fades you can see an metallic spider-like creature crawling over you.`,
  `Page 18: But you don't listen. You know it'll probably end your career, disobeying such an order. Or maybe, when this video gets to earth, you'll be the biggest social media sensation ever. None of that matters as you take one step at a time, drawing closer to the ship.
  \n
  Because you're the first human on an exoplanet.
  \n
  And you'll be the first human to touch an exocraft. To maybe look inside it.
  \n
  Continue to page 19.`,
  `Page 19: You stepped out on this planet during sunlight for the money shot. For the people back on Earth. For the gorgeous, panoramic vista that Earth Forward can license as a VR experience and sell for millions. To say that you could.
  \n
  You stepped out on this planet during sunlight for the money shot. For the people back on Earth. For the gorgeous, panoramic vista that Earth Forward can license as a VR experience and sell for millions. To say that you could.
  \n
  But Earth's social vanity had brought you out in the scorching day. The promise of ratings, and going viral.
  \n
  You are definitely about to go viral. You came here to find life on this world, but you found there's life beyond it.
  \n
  And maybe that life is still here.
  \n
  Maybe you'll be the first to meet it...
  \n
  You continue forward, sweating as your suit slowly heats up.  The environment system is struggling to keep up with the scorching temperature.
  \n
  But you make it to the ship.  You see what looks like a hatch on the side.
  \n
  You open the hatch, peering inside.  This is going to be the biggest discovery of our species!  
  \n
  To be continued...`,
  `Page 20: You flip on the comms system and begin your live-stream back to Earth.  "This is Aura-1 Reporting in.  Tonight I'm bring to you the wonders of Planet Beta!
  \n
  You become an instant world-wide celebrity as you show your discoveries.`,
