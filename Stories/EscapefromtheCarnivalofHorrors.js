“What do you want to do?” 

“I don’t know, Patty. What do you want to do?” 

“Not fair, Brad. I asked you first.” 

Patty and Brad. Your two best friends. Arguing. As usual. 

It’s the last week of August. And Patty and Brad haven’t stopped fighting 
since your summer vacation started. 

Patty likes being bossy. You don’t mind, though. It’s no big deal. 

It’s hard to win a fight with her anyway. You don’t know why Brad even 
tries. You guess it’s because he doesn’t want to look like a wimp in front of a 
girl. 

“There’s nothing to do. I guess I’ll just go home,” Brad says. He shoves 
his hands in his pockets. Then his shoulders slump and he sort of shrivels up. 
You guess Brad is kind of a wimp — even if he is your best friend. 

“You’re so boring, Brad,” Patty complains. Whenever Patty complains, 
her freckles really pop out. Now there are about a million of them spread 
across her face. 

“Hey! I know what we should do!” Patty suddenly bursts out.

“Let’s bike over to Bennet’s Field and watch them set up the carnival!” 



“I don’t know,” you answer. “It’s getting dark, and Mom said I have to be 
in by nine.” 

“It’s only a quick bike ride,” Brad says. “Are you some kind of wimp?” 

Brad calling you a wimp? You can’t believe it! 

“Okay. Okay,” you agree. “But if it’s as bad as last year, there won’t be 
much to see. Don’t you remember the main attraction?” you remind them. 
“The ride they called Terror Track? It turned out to be a baby choo-choo train 
that circled around and around and around.” 

It doesn’t matter what you say. Patty’s made up her mind. You’re going to 
ride over to the carnival. 

A hot, humid breeze blows in your face as you pedal along. Patty’s in the 
lead. No surprise. And Brad’s puffing behind you. 

It’s dark by the time you reach Bennet’s Field. 

You and your friends drop your bikes in the grass and race across the 
moonlit field, toward the huge wooden fence that surrounds the carnival.

As you reach the carnival entrance, you hear music coming from inside. 
Not the usual corny organ stuff they always play. But some really strange 
music. It sounds familiar and totally new at the same time. 

Brad stretches his neck to try to peer over the fence. But no luck. The 
fence is way too high. 

Patty jiggles the padlock on the gate. It’s sealed shut. 

“I guess we’ll have to wait until tomorrow night when the carnival 
opens,” Brad says. 

“No way,” Patty says. “Let’s climb the fence. Now!” 

“Are you crazy?” Brad says. “We’ll get caught!” 

“Come on. There’s probably no one in there,” Patty replies. 

Your friends turn to you to cast the deciding vote. You glance at your 
watch. It’s almost 9:00 p.m. If you’re going to get home in time, you should 
start back now. 

What are you going to do?

“Wh-what do you mean?” Brad asks, trembling all over. 



“I just had an idea. A great idea,” the man replies. “I want you kids to stay 
and try out the rides before the grand opening tomorrow.” 

Patty’s eyes open wide. “Cool!” she says. 

“Are you sure it’s all right with the owner?” you ask. 

“I’m Big Al, the manager. And what I say around here goes.” 

Big Al digs around in his checkered jacket and pulls out three maps. He 
hands one to each of you. 

“Study them carefully,” he says. “If you have any questions, ask them 
now.” 

Your eyes fall upon the map. You have a question. But when you gaze up, 
Big Al is gone. He’s vanished! 

“A whole carnival to ourselves!” Patty exclaims. “Where should we 
start?” 

You stare down at your map once again. You notice that the carnival is 
split in half. On one side are the rides. Tons of them. On the other side is the 
midway, packed with games of chance and the Freak Show. 

What will you try first?

“Come on, run!” you yell to Patty and Brad as you spin around. “There’s 
got to be another way out!” 

Big A1 blows a whistle. Its shrill blast hurts your ears. He blows it again 
and, suddenly, dozens and dozens of carnival people appear out of nowhere. 
But they don’t look the way they did before. 

Some have green flesh. Some are deathly white. Their rotting skin hangs 
from their bones. Above their sunken cheekbones, their eyes glow an eerie 
yellow. 

You watch in horror as more and more of them appear. 

What should you do? Your legs won’t budge. You can’t think clearly. 
You’re terrified! You stand there — frozen — in a trance. 

But Brad breaks the spell when he screams out, “They’re ghosts! That’s 
why they’re wearing those old-fashioned clothes. They’re dead!” 

“Watch out! Over there!” Patty yells. “That — that ghost... It’s coming 
right at us. Run!” 


Run to PAGE 127.

“Let’s do it!” you say to your friends. “Let’s climb the fence!” 



Patty is halfway up before you finish speaking. You let Brad go next. 
You’re last. 

It’s a hard climb up. There’s really no place on the fence to get a good 
grip. But you make it to the top, swing your legs over, and tumble down. You 
land on the grass. You’re inside! 

You and your friends gaze around. It’s pretty dark — the only light comes 
from torches. At first the carnival looks the same as it always does. Dinky 
rides. Hot dog wagons. Then the lights start to flicker on in every corner of 
the field — the rides start to move. It’s as if the whole place is magically 
coming to life. 

“Hey! Look at that giant roller coaster!” you exclaim, pointing up ahead. 
“They never had a roller coaster before!” 

“Yeah,” Brad agrees. “And the whole place is a lot bigger than last year!” 

“This is awesome!” Patty says as she sprints toward the rides. 


Race over to PAGE 7. 




7 

You and Brad take off after Patty. You all stop in front of the roller 
coaster. 

“Wow!” Patty says as she gazes up at it. “It’s like a rocket to outer space!” 

Beyond the roller coaster, you spy a castle surrounded by a moat. And a 
spooky-looking haunted house sitting high atop a hill. 

“These are the coolest rides I’ve ever seen!” you say. “They still have that 
dumb choo-choo train over there,” you point out, “but we could ride this stuff 
all night and never go near it!” 

Patty grabs your arm and tugs you over to the other side of the carnival — 
to the midway. Brad races after you. 

“Hey! Where are all those dinky wooden booths from last year?” you ask 
as you gawk at the amazing games of chance. 

They’re gone. And in their place are giant video games and huge spinning 
wheels studded with hundreds of blinking colored lights! 

“Get a load of that!” Brad suddenly cries out. 

You and Patty spin around. 

You can’t believe what you see! 


Be more amazed on PAGE 87. 




8 

You wander over to the Wheel of Chance and immediately notice two 
strange things. 

First, you read the sign on the booth. It says “Wheel of No Chance.” Then 
you hear the barker’s voice calling, “Step right up!” But there’s no one there. 

No one but a green-and-yellow parrot. 

“Excuse me,” you say, hoping someone will answer. “Is this game open?” 

“No, I’m standing by this wheel for my health,” the parrot cracks. “Now, 
do you want to spin or what?” 

The parrot is obviously annoyed. “Mammals,” he mutters. “Can’t live 
with them, can’t live without them.” 

You steal a glance around. Maybe you should skip this game. But Big A1 
sneaks up behind you. 

“Spin,” he says. “You must earn enough points to win.” 

“But how will I know if I have enough points?” you ask. 

“Spin!” It’s his final word. 


Go to PAGE 9. 


9 

Here’s how to spin: 



Close your eyes and twirl your finger over the wheel on this page. Then 
let your finger land somewhere on the wheel. Look at the number you’ve 
landed on. Go to that page next. 



Quick! Go to the page you landed on! 
OR 

If you landed on spin again, spin again. 









10 

You’ve decided not to sneak into the carnival? You’re going home 
instead? Well, it’s a good thing Patty usually makes all the decisions. 
Otherwise, you’d never have any fun! And this book would be over before it 
began! 

Go ahead. Take a deep breath. Then go climb the fence. You’re not scared 
— are you? 

Turn back to PAGE 6. 




11 

You’ve decided to help the freaks. As you race down the midway, you 
spot Brad and Patty. 

“Listen, guys,” you tell them, lowering your voice. “We’ve got a problem. 
A big problem.” 

You take a deep breath and tell them all about Madame Zeno and the blue 
card. 

“So,” you finish saying, “somebody might need our help in the back of 
the Freak Show.” 

“What’s a freak?” Brad asks nervously. 

“Remember the poster we saw when we came in? The one with the three¬ 
headed man and the lady with the snake body?” you remind him. 

Brad bites down on his lip. “Are they really real?” 

“Sure they’re real,” Patty chimes in. “I once saw a bearded lady at the 
circus.” 

“I don’t know,” Brad says. “It sounds kind of creepy.” 

“Well, Madame Zeno said this was my fate. I’m going to help them — 
whatever they are. Are you guys in?” 

“You bet,” Patty answers, her eyes shining with excitement. 

“Okay, okay. I’ll go,” Brad mumbles. 

“Then let’s hurry!” you exclaim. 


Race to the back of the Freak Show on PAGE 35 . 




12 

You run to the right. “Follow me!” you cry out to Patty and Brad. 

You run faster than you’ve ever run in your life. Your sides ache, but you 
keep on going. 

When your chest feels as if it’s about to burst, you finally stop. And hear a 
crash behind you. Then at both sides of you. Then in front of you. Trapping 
you. 

“Welcome to the Reptile’s Petting Zoo,” a deep voice echoes through the 
darkness. 

Reptile’s Petting Zoo? You thought the sign said Reptile Petting Zoo. 

“Our alligator has been so lonely,” the deep voice continues. “Waiting and 
waiting — for his new pets to arrive. And here you are — finally.” 

THE END 



13 

The room is dark, but all around you, you hear hushed moans. “Help us! 
Help us!” 

“We’re in a prison,” Patty says. “And look at the prisoners! They’re 
weird!” 

Patty is right. As your eyes grow accustomed to the darkness, you see cell 
after cell. Each one holds a strange-looking prisoner. There’s an enormous fat 
lady who’s nearly busting out of the bars. A giant. A dwarf. A young lady 
with boa constrictors wrapped around her waist. And a woman with a long 
black beard! 

“We’re the freakssss,” the Snake Lady says. “Every night when the 
sssshow endssss, the masssster lockssss ussss up.” 

“The master? You mean Big A1 is —” you start to say. 

“You must help us!” the giant interrupts. 

“Sssssssh,” the Snake Lady says. “The master’sssss coming — you 
musssstn’t be here! Go! That way!” She points to a door down the hall. 

Escape through the door down the hall, go to PAGE 48 . 

Stay and talk to Big Al, go to PAGE 62 .

You reach out slowly and touch the red card. 

To your amazement, a 3-D heart magically appears and rises from the flat 
surface. Then it starts to beat! Tha-dump, tha-dump. It must be some fancy 
optical illusion. You lean closer to figure out the trick. 

“Yowwwww!” you screech and jerk back to avoid the warm red liquid 
that nearly squirts in your eye. Is it blood? It looks like blood. “Wow! Cool 
effect,” you say. “How did you do it?” 

“Turn over the card,” Madame Zeno orders. “Do it now!” 

Madame Zeno really gets into her act. Doesn’t she know this is just a 
game? you think. But you do as you’re told. 

Big deal. No weird pictures. No hidden fortunes. All you see are the 
numbers 1,3,2 shimmering in gold script against a midnight background. 
“What does it mean?” you ask. 

“You will know when the time is right,” the fortune-teller whispers. Her 
voice is so low, you can barely hear her. “It could save your life!” 


What does she mean ? Turn to PAGE 41 to find out. 




15 

Round and round the wheel spins. It finally lands on number 15. no 

CHANCE. 

No chance. Does that mean what you think it means? 

No chance at all. 

Zip. 

Zero. 

Nothing. 

Nada. 

Negatory. 

Yes. That’s exactly what it means. You have met... 

THE END 



16 

“Hi!” you say to Big Al. “Who are all those people?” 

He doesn’t really answer your question. 

“Welcome to the Carnival of Horrors,” he says. “You must play or pay. 
We have many games on our midway. You must play two.” He practically 
spits the word must out. “If you succeed, you can win prizes. But if you lose, 
you pay with your life!” 

Boy, he’s really laying it on thick, you think. But it’s a pretty cool 
gimmick. “Okay, I’ll play a game. Then I’ve got to go home.” 

“No one goes home,” Big Al says, “until they play. You must play two 
games. And survive.” 

“Okay. Okay,” you mutter to yourself. 

You glance around the midway at the two closest games. Guess Your 
Weight on Mars and the Wheel of Chance. You have to pick one to start, or 
you’ll never get out of here. 

For Guess Your Weight on Mars, go to PAGE 72 . 

To play Wheel of Chance, go to PAGE 8 . 





17 

You take a few steps along the midway hoping you’ve won enough prizes 
and points. You notice the crowd of people surrounding Big Al. They’re still 
chanting, “PAY OR PLAY PAY OR PLAY” 

You break through the crowd and grab Big Al’s arm. “Hey! Do you know 
where my friends are?” 

“Certainly,” Big Al says, pointing up ahead. “They’re right over there!” 

“Patty! Brad!” you shout as you rush up to them. “Come on! We’ve got to 
go! This carnival is evil!” 

But before they can say a word, Big Al’s voice booms from behind you. 
“Not before The Final Challenge!” 

The Final Challenge begins on PAGE 84 . 




18 

The space lady slowly circles you as she sizes you up from head to toe. 
“Hmmmm, I think you weigh thirty-eight pounds.” 

“Thirty-eightpounds! Boy, are you wrong!” 

“I’m never wrong,” she says, smirking. She snaps her fingers and two 
enormous guards appear. They each take one of your arms and drag you out 
of the courtyard. 

“I don’t weigh thirty-eight pounds!” you yell. But then you remember. It 
isn’t your weight on Earth that matters. It’s your weight on Mars. 

Do you weigh thirty-eight pounds on Mars? You’d better find out quickly, 
because something tells you that what Big A1 said about having to survive 
might be true. 

Weigh in on PAGE 134 . 




19 

You land on number 19. 

“Double or nothing. Double or nothing,” two voices behind you echo. 

You whirl around — and gasp! It’s a man with two heads. 

“Congratulations. You win ten points,” one head says to you. “Quit while 
you’re ahead!” 

“Ahead, get it? Ahead!” the other head adds, laughing hysterically. 

“Shut up,” head number one says. 

“You shut up,” head number two shoots back. “Ten points is nothing. You 
better spin again. And this time it’s double or nothing. You get double the 
points wherever you land.” 

Which head should you listen to? 

If you think you don’t have enough points, go back to PAGE 9 and 
spin again. 

If you think you have enough points and you haven’t played Guess Your 
Weight, go to PAGE 72 . 

If you have played Guess Your Weight, go to PAGE 1 7 . 






20 

It seems as if hours have passed. Or maybe it’s only minutes. 

You try to unclasp your hands. But they won’t budge. It’s as if your arms 
are glued around your knees. 

You try to move something. Anything. 

But you can’t blink an eyelid. Your body is paralyzed. You can’t even 
scream. 

A door opens and two men dressed in overalls and wearing gas masks 
amble in. Finally. They’re here to rescue you! 

“Looks like the perfume worked,” you hear one of them say. 

“Yeah. And just in time. We needed a new dummy for the Real-Life 
Space Display,” the other adds. 

They pick up your rigid body and carry you out. No wonder those 
astronauts in the silver tunnel looked so real! 

Sorry. You can’t scream. You can’t escape. 

Next time, you promise yourself, you’ll stick with the baby rides. But 
then you remember — there isn’t going to be a next time ... because this is ... 


THE END 



21 

You’re outside — standing in Bennet’s Field — gazing at the fence that 
surrounds the carnival. 

“I guess we’ll have to wait until tomorrow night when the carnival 
opens,” Brad says. 

“No way,” Patty says. “Let’s climb the fence.” 

What’s going on here? 

You guessed it. The silver locker was a time machine. You’ve gone back 
in time to the first moment you spotted the carnival. Now it appears as if you 
have to start all over again — fighting horror after horror, right up to ... 

THE END 



22 

You’re pretty sure that the space lady guessed wrong! Now all you have 
to do is step on the scale to prove it. 

The two goons shove you inside the planet simulation chamber. It’s a long 
narrow tube, and it’s really stuffy inside. You can barely breathe. 

You step up on the scale. You check the readout. Boy, oh, boy! The space 
lady is wrong! 

You jump up and down. “I won! I won!” 

Back outside you collect your prize. It’s a huge chocolate bar. You take a 
big bite out of it and stuff the rest in your pocket. 

You gaze around. The coast is clear. Maybe you can find Patty and Brad 
and get out of here. 

You walk a few steps forward. But a heavy hand clamps down on your 
shoulder from behind. 

It’s Big Al. 

“It’s time to play another game,” he says, grinning. 


If you have not tried the Wheel of Chance, go to PAGE 8 . 

If you Ve already played the Wheel of Chance, go to PAGE 17 . 





23 

You yank on the reins. But your horse plows ahead, pulling you forward 
— closer and closer to the chopping, chopping, chopping blades. Brad 
squinches down in the cart and buries his head in his lap. 

Patty jumps into the front seat with you. Together you pull on the reins 
and scream, “Whoa, fellow! Whoa!” 

But your horse trots onward. “It’s no use,” you cry. “We’d better jump!” 

You stare over the side. You’re riding along a narrow ridge and there’s a 
deep drop that makes your blood run cold! If you jump, you’ll plunge to your 
death! 

Then you glance up ahead — and spot a safer place to leap. Great! 

You are about to show it to your friends when Brad cries out, “Look at the 
elves! They chop at set times. If we can get the horse to move faster, we can 
miss the axes!” 

“That’s dumb, we should jump!” argues Patty. 

What do you think you should do? 


If you decide to jump out, go to PAGE 103 . 

If you urge the horse to gallop, go to PAGE 119 . 





24 

Carnival workers. The carnival workers who set up the same rinky-dink 
carnival you go to every summer. 

You can’t believe your eyes. You must be seeing things! 

Patty tries to say something smart, but the only thing she manages is 
“Huh?” 

“Hey, kids!” a worker yells at you. “Get away from that ride. The carnival 
doesn’t start till tomorrow night.” 

You gaze around in wonder at the faded games, the baby rides, the tacky 
food stands. For the first time in your life, it all looks great! 

“We’ll be there!” you shout as you head for your bikes. “This is the 
greatest carnival I’ve ever seen!” 

THE END 



25 

Seconds later your head and the back of your feet slam into the wall. 
You’re hanging upside down — in the middle of a gigantic magnetic wheel! 

“Are you ready for The Final Challenge?” Big A1 asks. 

“Of course not!” you say. “LET ME DOWN!” 

“We’ll let you down — but not until you face The Final Challenge. One 
spin will decide your fate. If you win, you go. If you lose, you stay here 
forever.” 

Will that be your fate? 

Big A1 approaches the wheel. 

Brad and Patty are holding on to each other. 

Your heart is pounding. 

Your hands are sweating. 

This is it. One spin. 

He gives the wheel — with you on it — a hard turn. Where will it stop? 
Guess!

On PAGE 124? 






26 

“Hey, wait up!” you yell to Brad and Patty as you sprint through the 
Space Coaster gate. 

They both ignore you and charge straight ahead. You follow them into a 
narrow tunnel that leads to the boarding area. 

You gaze down at the floor. Black rubber. It makes you walk with a 
strange bounce. 

Every few feet there is a round porthole window. When you glance out 
one, you see astronauts planting flags on the moon. You peer out another. 
Now they’re seated in their capsule. This is amazing, you think. The figures 
look real. Totally real. 

After a long climb, you and Patty and Brad finally arrive at the loading 
area. 

A sleek bullet-shaped capsule whooshes up and stops right beside you. It 
has three sections. Brad climbs defiantly into the last section. You leap into 
the front. Patty’s left with the middle section. 

And suddenly you’re trapped! 


Go on to PAGE 58. 




27 

The crowd is closing in. Your pockets are empty — you have nothing to 
defend yourself with. So you run! 

You spot a crack in the wall, next to the wheel. It’s small — too small for 
an adult to squeeze through — but you can probably make it. 

“Follow me!” you yell out to Patty and Brad as you squeeze through the 
opening. It leads to a backstage area — and then to the flap of another tent. 

You can hear the crowd behind you, trying to follow you through the 
crack. 

“Come on! We can slip under this tent,” you say. For once, no one argues 
with you. 

The three of you duck in and find yourself surrounded by another crowd. 
They are all seated in chairs. And they don’t move. They just stare at you with 
glassy eyes. 


Turn to PAGE 55. 




28 

What’s the big idea? You’re going to embarrass the giant into helping 
you. 

“Hey, you. You know, you’re a real wimp,” you say to the giant. 

He looks at you as if he can’t believe what he hears. 

Patty and Brad look at you as if you’re crazy. 

Maybe you are. 

“You wimp,” you continue. “You sit here all day, taking orders from that 
creep, Big Al. And you live in these horrible conditions. Why? Because 
you’re a wimp and you refuse to fight back. You could bend those bars and 
escape — but you won’t. Because you are a wimp — W-I-M-P — wimp.” 

The giant stands. You gaze up. He’s over fifteen feet tall. He lumbers over 
to you. He isn’t smiling. 

Is your plan going to work? Is he going to bend the bars to prove you 
wrong? Or is he going to bend you? 

It’s out of your control now. 

Look out the window. 


If it’s sunny out, turn to PAGE 45 . 

If it’s raining or if it’s nighttime, turn to PAGE 85 . 





29 

You stumble down the corridor to your right. As you peer from side to 
side, you are met with hundreds of images of — you! And you look pretty 
baffled. And scared. 

“Hey, I could use some help,” you call out. 

Silence. 

You pound your fist against the wall. 

The wall starts to move. 

Just an inch or two — an inch or two closer to you! 

You take a step back — but the wall behind you is moving, too. 

The walls are moving together. They’re closing in on you. 

You’re going to be crushed! 

Squeeze over to PAGE 65 . 




30 

You’re falling ... falling ... You can’t think of anything else to do, so you 
start flapping your arms like a bird. 

At that moment a huge gust of air shoots up from under you and blows 
you back onto the bridge. 

Breathing hard, you run the rest of the way across the rickety span. When 
you reach the safety of the other side, you glance back. And gasp! The bridge 
and the midway beyond it have vanished! Only a black void remains! 

“Wow! Awesome special effects!” you cry out loud. But was your fall part 
of the special effects, too? It didn’t feel like it. 

You spin around to face the House of Horrors. Up close it appears really, 
really creepy. Cobwebs drip down from its roof and an eerie yellow light 
glows inside. Cool! Next to the house you spot a sign that reads boat trip to 
nowhere. There are amazing speedboats that you can drive yourself. 

Which should you try first?

31 

You snap your head around to the right — where you hear footsteps 
coming toward you. 

You are facing a short man with wrinkly skin and bloodshot eyes. His 
bushy black hair resembles a scouring pad — and from the looks of it, it 
probably feels like one, too. His evil expression makes you cringe. 

But he’s nothing compared to the “things” in back of him — two seven- 
foot-tall monsters. One has blue horns and bulging red eyes. The other has 
scaly skin and an alligator snout that snaps open and closed as he eyes you. 

The trio all wear lab coats. And from the eager way they’re looking at 
you, you realize that you are the lab rat. 

You struggle to escape from the net. But you’re trapped in the webbing. 
Like a fly in a spider’s web. 

“Welcome to my humble laboratory,” the short man says. “I am Dr. Frank 
N. Stone, the mastermind who created the Carnival of Horrors.” 

The Carnival of Horrors! You don’t like the sound of that! 


Go to PAGE 89.

Your boat glides through the channel at high speed to Booger Bog. Water 
sprays up into your face. But soon you have to slow down. Trees have 
suddenly sprung up all around you. You’re completely surrounded now by 
their towering trunks. 

In the dark light, their limbs take on the shape of gnarled arms with 
blackened, bony fingers at the ends. You stare hard at the tree trunks. Could it 
be? Are they reaching out for you? 

You slowly weave the boat through the twisted trunks and branches. 
They’ve grown so thick here that you can barely pilot your boat through 
them. 

The trees rustle as if they’re whispering to each other. Their limbs begin 
to sway. As you glide carefully through the water, the leaves slap against your 
face. Slap. Slap. Slap. 

Your heart starts hammering away in your chest. This is really scary. Just 
how far is nowhere? you begin to wonder. Something swipes at your hair! 
What was that?

You glance once more at the dwarf. He lets out an evil cackle. That’s it — 
there’s no way you can trust him. Besides, you can hear music up ahead. 
You’re sure you must be near an exit. 

“No, thanks. I don’t need any help,” you mumble. 

He shrugs. “Oh, yes, you do,” he says. But then he sprints off. 

You walk in the direction of the music. But after five minutes, you realize 
that you’re not getting anywhere. 

Maybe you should have followed the dwarf. You start to think about Patty 
and Brad. Are they okay? you wonder. 

Just when you think you’ll be wandering these tunnels for the rest of your 
life, the passageway ends! Now you’re facing two doors — one red and one 
blue. Which one should you try? You might as well flip a coin! 

Get a coin. Flip it and check whether it comes up heads or tails. 

If it comes up heads, take the blue door to PAGE 57 . 

If it comes up tails, take the red door to PAGE 104 .

“Let’s go on the rides first!” you say. “That roller coaster looked 
awesome!” 

“Okay,” Patty agrees. “Over this way!” she yells as she charges over to it. 

When you reach the rides, you can only stare in amazement. These are the 
most fantastic rides you’ve ever seen. The towering roller coaster ... the 
soaring speedboats ... the twisty slides! Every one is in motion. Whizzing, 
whirling, doing loop-the-loops. And they’re all empty! No riders. No people 
in line! 

“Cool!” Patty exclaims. “We have the whole place to ourselves.” 

Brad’s face turns a little green as his gaze swings from the Supersonic 
Space Coaster to the Doom Slide. “Do you think they have rides that don’t go 
upside down?” he asks. 

“Come on! Let’s check out the coaster!” Patty calls to you and Brad. Then 
they run off to its starting gate. 

You stop and crane your neck to gaze up at the coaster’s first hill. And 
you gasp! 


Quick! Go to PAGE 47 . 




35 

Five minutes later, the three of you are sneaking down a dark alley. Brad 
is so frightened, he’s practically walking on top of you. 

The alley is littered with large cardboard boxes and overflowing trash 
cans. And it smells like dead fish. 

“Hey! Quit stepping on my shoe,” you say to Brad. 

“I’m not stepping on your shoe,” he shoots back. “I’m not anywhere near 
your stupid shoe.” 

You glance down. And nearly scream. 

Brad’s right. He’s not stepping on you. But about a dozen rats are. 

You shake your foot wildly. The rats scurry off. 

Brad catches sight of the rats and tries to bolt. 

You and Patty quickly pull him back. 

“Hey! Look!” Patty says, pointing up ahead. “A door!” 

On the door you see a big sign that reads keep out, so ... you go in. 


Go to PAGE 13. 




36 

You turn back and head in the other direction. Your reflections bounce off 
the walls at crazy angles. Are you walking straight, or have you rounded a 
corner? There’s no way to tell. Yet this time you’re sure you’re going the right 
way! 

“Over here!” a voice calls. “Turn left again!” 

Turn left again ? Now you are really confused. 

If you turn left again, will you finally escape? 

Turn to PAGE 118 . 

HELP! 




37 

You cover your head with your hands and try to run into a thick grove of 
trees. But the bat circles in front of you and dives again. 

“Stop it! Stop it!” you scream. 

As you turn and race toward some low bushes, you remember the stories 
— the horrible stories about bats making nests in people’s hair. And the only 
way to get them out was to shave your head.... 

Those stories weren’t true — were they? 

You spot a big stick in the wet dirt and scoop it up. 

The bat swoops down at you once more and — FWAP! You hit it. 

The bat falls to the ground. 

And you see it’s on a wire. 

It’s a mechanical bat. 

All part of the ride, you think. You think about the boat ride. Boy, they 
really make things seem real at this carnival, you think. You feel much better 
when you gaze up ahead. There’s a clearing. 

But when you see what’s there — you scream! 


Turn to PAGE 93.

“Got a winner, got a winner,” the parrot squawks. “You’ve won twenty- 
five points, plus anything you want in the prize room. Step this way.” 

Eagerly, you follow the bird into a storeroom behind the booth. It’s 
packed with the weirdest assortment of junk you’ve ever seen. Dusty old 
catalogs, stuffed rats, a collection of axes, and portraits of headless people 
holding their own heads! 

“So pick something. It’s getting late,” the parrot says. 

Not this garbage, you think. Then you spot a shelf of small cans with 
bright labels: play and glow, clay slime, and monster blood. Monster 
Blood? Hey, isn’t that the magic stuff you read about in GOOSEBUMPS? 

“I’ll take the Monster Blood,” you decide. 

“Excellent choice,” the parrot remarks. 

As you quickly leave the room with your prize, you wonder, is twenty- 
five points enough? What do you do next? 

If you want to spin again for more points, go to PAGE 9 .

You close your eyes. When you open them, your car lunges forward with 
a burst of speed — and you loop-the-loop. Your mouth drops open to scream, 
but no sound comes out. 

Now your car starts to plunge downward — like an elevator out of 
control. Your heart pounds in your chest. This is the fastest and best roller 
coaster you’ve ever been on! As you near the bottom, you slow down. You 
begin to catch your breath. And then you see what’s up ahead. A huge black 
hole — a tunnel! 

As you shoot toward the open mouth of the tunnel, you begin to scream 
again. The door of the tunnel is about to close! 

Snap! The door comes crashing down — behind your car. You breathe out 
a long sigh. But now you’re in a tunnel so dark that you can’t see a thing. 

Scary! But not nearly as scary as what happens next. 


What happens? Turn to PAGE 94 to find out!

“Five, four, three, two, one. We have liftoff,” a mechanical voice 
announces. 

To your horror, the rocket blasts off! You’re slammed against the side of 
the capsule with hurricane force. Seconds later, you’ve left Earth’s 
atmosphere. 

A recorded message comes on: “Congratulations. You are the perfect 
weight for our Mars explorer. We’ll be monitoring your trip and will bring 
you back in approximately twenty years — with a plus or minus ten-year 
margin of error in case something goes wrong. But do not worry. Nothing can 
go wrong ... go wrong ... go wrong.” 

THE END 



41 

“What do you mean the magic number could save my life?” you ask 
Madame Zeno. But the fortune-teller doesn’t answer. She stares off into 
space. She seems to have fallen into a deep trance. 

You don’t really believe her — these fortune-tellers are all fakes, but you 
memorize the number anyway. 1-3-2,1-3-2.1 picked red instead of blue, 
you chant to help you remember. 

Madame Zeno puts the card back in the deck. She closes her eyes and 
waves you away with her jeweled hand. 

You guess the fortune-telling is over, so you leave the tent to search for 
Patty and Brad. 

You squint under the bright lights of the midway, scanning all the game 
booths. But you can’t find them. 

You’re trying to figure out which way to go when you spot Big A1 coming 
toward you. He’s not alone. He’s leading a large group of people. As they 
come closer, you hear that they are chanting something. What is it? 

“PLAY OR PAY. PLAY OR PAY.” 

What does that mean? 


Turn to PAGE 16 to find out. 




42 

A wave of panic washes over you as the walls crumble around you. You 
throw your arms over your head and close your eyes. 

Then silence. The shaking stops. 

When you open your eyes, the room and all the costumed people have 
vanished. And you are outside — in the rides area! But the biggest surprise of 
all is that you spot Patty and Brad! 

“Boy, am I glad to see you,” you say, racing over to them. “Where have 
you guys been?” 

Brad shakes his head. “You wouldn’t believe the rides we were on!” 

“We’ve got to get out of here before midnight,” you say. Quickly, you tell 
your friends about the warning from the lady with the red parasol. 

“No problem,” Patty says. “Look. I’m sure the exit is right over there past 
that ride called the Hall of the Mountain King.” 

“No, it’s that way — near the sign that says ‘Halloween Express,’ ” Brad 
insists. 

Which way do you think is the right way? 

Halloween Express ? Then turn to PAGE 108 . 

Mountain King? Then turn to PAGE 107 . 



43 

You are about to scream. It seems like the only sensible thing to do. 
And then you remember the sign. 

Reptile Petting Zoo. 



You have an idea. It’s a crazy idea, you know. But everything in this 
carnival is crazy. 

You can feel the alligator’s hot breath on your arm. But instead of pulling 
your arm back, you stretch it out! 

“What are you doing?” Patty screams. 

Your fingers reach out. Out over the alligator’s open snout to the top of 
his head. 

And you pet him. 

“Nice alligator,” you purr as you stroke his scaly head. 

Your arm trembles, but you don’t stop. And slowly — very slowly — the 
creature’s mouth begins to shut. 

Then he rolls over and falls asleep! 

You slip quietly off the log, charge for the shore — and plow right into 
Big Al! 

“Well, well, well. Look who we have here,” Big Al sings out. “Come with 
me. It’s time for The Final Challenge.” 


You have no choice. Follow Big Al to PAGE 84 . 




44 

You’re spinning round and round. Everything is a blur. You can’t see, but 
you hear the crowd chanting, “FI-NAL! FI-NAL! FI-NAF!” 

And then the wheel stops. 

A huge gasp escapes from the audience. 

Did you win or lose? 

Neither. You stopped on spin again. 

Go back to PAGE 25 and spin again. 




45 

The giant looms over you. He’s as tall as the tree outside your house — 
and a lot meaner. His huge lips part and he says, “You hurt my feelings.” 

Then he begins to cry. 

“I am not a wimp. I am not,” he says between huge sobs. 

He sure looks like a wimp. 

Turn to PAGE 98. 




46 

You’re falling ... falling ... everything passes as if you’re dropping in 
slow motion. Is this ... 


THE END ? 
Yes. 



47 

The tracks stretch up so high that they seem to touch the clouds. Your 
gaze follows one of the cars speeding around a sharp curve. It looks like the 
space shuttle. You notice that it has a safety harness that locks over your body 
— you’ve seen those before. They keep you in when the ride turns upside 
down. You didn’t want to admit it before, but, like Brad, riding upside down 
is not your favorite thing. 

Still, the coaster does look amazing — one part enters a tunnel — and you 
can see that the cars go fast. Really Fast! 

You’re just about to walk through the Space Coaster gate when you hear 
spooky organ music coming from behind you. You turn around. Looming in 
the distance is a dark and creepy haunted house. 

You gaze down at your map. It’s called the House of Horrors. Hmmm. 

You love haunted houses. And this one really looks scary. 

Now you’re not sure what to do. You won’t have time for everything. The 
coaster or the haunted house? Decide now. 

If you decide to join Patty and Brad on the Space Coaster, get on 
board on PAGE 26. 


If you want to go to the House of Horrors alone, go to PAGE 64 . 





48 

“Come on!” Patty cries. “Come on!” 

Then, without another word, she races off. You and Brad dash after her. 

I hope Patty knows what she’s doing, you think as you try to catch up. 
Because right now, it doesn’t look that way. 

Patty leads you through a maze of underground passageways. Then, just 
as you’re about to yell, “Stop!” — she does. And you find yourself standing 
outside, in front of a barbed-wire fence! 

Up ahead, you spot an opening. 

“Let’s go in!” Patty says. 

The three of you creep through the fence and trudge through some tall, 
wet grass. You gaze around. It’s way too dark to see. 

But you can hear perfectly. And the sounds that reach your ears make 
your skin crawl. 

Slithering. You definitely hear slithering. 

And hissing. 

You want to leave. You spin around, but you can’t find the opening in the 
fence! You do see something else. A sign! 


Hurry to PAGE 60 . 




49 

The wheel stops on free spin. You are ready to try again. But the dumb 
parrot flies over and latches onto your shoulder. 

“Ouch! That hurts,” you cry. 

“Free spin, free spin, you’re going on a free spin.” 

“Turn me loose,” you command. When you swivel your head to glare at 
the bird, a scream freezes in your throat. The parrot has ballooned into an 
enormous vulture. His black, beady eyes pierce right through you. He digs his 
razor-sharp claws deeper into your shoulder. 

Run! — your every survival instinct shouts. But the bird of prey has other 
ideas. One of them is dinner — with you as the main course. 

The big bird snatches you by the back of your shirt as if you were a rag 
doll. Kicking and screaming and using every defensive move you learned 
from karate class, you struggle for your life. But it’s no use. With a jerk he 
lifts you off the ground. 

And suddenly you have a frightening view of the carnival from twenty 
feet... thirty feet ... fifty feet up. 


Fly on to PAGE 50 . 




50 

Thummp, thump, thump. Your heart bangs loudly inside your chest. What 
kind of carnival is this, you wonder, where a free spin is more like a death 
sentence? 

You circle a green clump of treetops. You’re really dizzy now. You want 
to close your eyes. But you know it’s not a good idea — since you’re flying 
fifty feet high without a plane or a parachute. 

As you circle closer to the treetops, you are met with a horrifying view. 
Five baby vultures in a nest, five very hungry babies, with mouths gaping 
wide open. 

The end is near. You are going to wind up as a take-home dinner. Unless 
you can somehow force the vulture to let you go. Frantically, you reach into 
your pockets!

51 

You can’t take on both monsters, so you decide to wait until one of them 
leaves the room. 

You grab hold of Dr. Stone’s hand. He’s a lot stronger than he looks. With 
one small tug, he pulls you free of the web. 

Then he turns to the monsters. “Okay,” he barks. “Adjust the net. It’s time 
to practice spiking.” 

Spiking? What does he mean by that? 

The monsters leap up. They rub their hands together in evil delight. Then 
they untie the net and head to the back of the room, where two huge poles rest 
on the floor. 

You close your eyes — and hope that when you open them, you’ll see that 
this was all a dream. A really bad dream. 

But when you open your eyes, you know it’s not a dream. No — it’s a 
volleyball game. The net has been tied to the poles — and guess what position 
you play? That’s right. You’re the ball! Watch out for those two-handed 
spikes! They can be pretty painful! 


THE END 



52 

Just as the clock strikes twelve, the train enters a tunnel. 

You hold your breath, wondering what you’ll see when you reach the 
other end. 

Chug. Chug. Chug. 

The choo-choo slowly pulls out of the tunnel — and you are surrounded 
by carnival workers — everywhere! 

Chug to PAGE 24 . 




53 

Oh, no! You think the space lady guessed right! Now what’s going to 
happen? 

The two guards shove you into the space chamber. 

It’s a clear, narrow tube that rises farther up than you can see. 

As the door slams shut behind you, one of the guards barks, “Get on the 
scale!” 

You step up on the scale — and it shows just how right the space lady’s 
guess was. 

You press the chamber-door release, but it’s stuck. 

You try again. It doesn’t budge. 

Maybe it’s locked from the outside. 

“Hey! I can’t get out!” you yell to the guards. But they simply wave. 

“Hey, let me out!” Now you’re mad. “Let me out!” 

All at once the room starts to shake and rattle. RRRRRRRR. The thrust of 
powerful rocket engines echoes in your ears. It sounds as if you’re being 
launched into space. But that’s impossible, isn’t it? 


Go to PAGE 40. 




54 

Your Halloween Express car pulls up in front of a cottage and the cottage 
door opens with a creak. You all jerk your heads up to peer at the door. You 
see a skeleton wearing an evil smile. And he lunges right for you! 

“Trick or treat!” he screeches. Then he stretches out his bony hands to 
snatch you! 

You pound on the gas pedal, and the car shoots forward — out of the 
skeleton’s grasp! 

Your heart begins to race as the car speeds out of control. You tear 
through an eerie forest, speed past more cottages — but still you don’t see a 
way out. 

And then it comes into view — a service exit! 

All you have to do is stop the car, jump out, and scramble through the 
fence, and you’ll be free. 

You check your watch — five minutes to midnight! 

“Oh, no!” Patty screams. “Quick, turn left! Don’t stop!” 


Turn left! And go to PAGE 83 . 




55 

They’re dummies. That’s why they don’t move! 

“They’ve got to be here somewhere,” you hear Big Al’s voice boom 
outside the tent. 

“Hey! This dummy looks just like the one in that GOOSEBUMPS book,” 
Patty says. 

“You mean Night of the Living Dummy?” Brad asks. 

Great! you think. Your friends are chatting about books minutes before 
you’re about to be attacked by a mob. Then you get an idea. 

“Remember those magic words that brought the dummy to life in that 
book?” you ask your friends. “Maybe we can bring this guy to life and he’ll 
help us — he was pretty tough.” 

Your friends agree — it’s worth a try.

56 

You leap out of the boat. The putrid brown water splashes into your 
mouth. Gross! 

You swim a few strokes and suddenly find your knees scraping the bottom 
of the bog. The water here is less than a foot deep. Unbelievable! You were 
practically inches away from safety the entire time! 

Slogging through the brown foam, you wade to shore. Your clothes are 
dripping wet and smell like a sewer. Well, look at the bright side, you remind 
yourself. At least you didn’t go down with your boat. 

But your troubles aren’t over yet. You’re standing in a dank, eerie forest 
that surrounds the lake. Creepy screeches echo through the night mist. And 
you’re totally lost. 

The wind starts to blow. Shivering, you wrap your arms around your 
shoulders and wonder where your friends are and what they are doing. 

Then — POW! Something black and furry swoops down at you! You 
duck your head, but it comes at you again and again. 

A huge bat! 


Turn to PAGE 37. 




57 

You open the blue door and peer through. You’re staring down a long 
dark passageway. At least you think it’s long. It’s difficult to tell. It’s pitch- 
black. You don’t know what to do. 

“Maybe I should have picked the other door,” you say to yourself. “I’m 
getting out of here!” 

But the blue door has locked behind you! Now you’re sure you made the 
wrong choice. But there’s nowhere to go but forward. 

Your knees begin to tremble as you inch your way down the dark hallway. 

The passage ends in a bright burst of light. And in front of you, a tall 
purple mountain rises hundreds of feet into the air. 

You breathe out a long sigh of relief. You’re out of the dark! 

You study the mountain. It looks so real! But cut into its side, you spot a 
doorway. Above it a brightly painted sign reads: doom slide, will you be the 

ONE TO SLIDE FOREVER? 


Turn to PAGE 135. 




58 

Steel bars plunge down from above and drop across your lap and chest, 
pinning you in place. You can’t move at all. Even your head is held by 
superstrong headphones that clamp over your ears. A voice comes through 
them announcing: “Five, four, three, two, one, BLAST OFF!” 

You hear a huge bang. Smoke and fireworks fill the air as your car starts 
up the first big hill. Your head presses back against the seat as you climb 
higher and higher. That first hill is endless, but the view is awesome. From the 
top, you can see the midway, the haunted house, and a shadowy swamp. You 
can’t believe how big the carnival is! 

“Neat!” Patty yells. “There’s AHHHH —” 

Whatever she was going to say turns into a wild scream as the rocket 
plunges down the other side of the hill. The wind whips at your face. You are 
pressed back so hard, you feel like a pancake. Everything passes in a fantastic 
blur. 

As your car shoots up to the top of the next hill, you’re laughing and 
screaming at the same time. This is great, you think! But then you make a big 
mistake. 


Turn to PAGE 39. 




59 

Blue is your favorite color. You turn the blue card over. 

There is a message: Help us! You are our only hope. Hurry to the back 
door of the freak show. Signed, The Freaks. 

“What does this mean?” you ask Madame Zeno. She stares deep into your 
eyes. Her lips tremble. She leans forward. She’s about to speak. 

And then the lights go out — and a blood-curdling scream rips through 
the dark! 

You start to bolt for the door when a dim light suddenly flickers. You stare 
across the table. Madame Zeno is gone! 

You reach out to take the card. And it bursts into red-hot flames! In 
seconds, the entire tent fills with thick smoke. Flames shoot across the floor. 
You run for the door. 

Outside, you gulp the fresh air. Whew! You made it. 

You glance back. No smoke. No fire. No tent! Everything has 
disappeared! What should you do now? 

If you decide to help the freaks, go to PAGE 11 . 

If you don’t want to help the freaks, go to PAGE 113 .

“There’s a sign!” you call out to Patty and Brad. “Let’s see what it says.” 

The three of you race through the wet grass. Your socks are drenched. 
And your sneakers squeak as you run. But that’s not the sound that’s sending 
chills down your spine. 

It’s the hissing. It’s growing louder. 

“I’m not sure I want to read that sign,” you call out to Patty and Brad. 

“I know what you mean!” Patty shouts back. “I have a feeling we’re not 
going to like what it says.” 

And you don’t. You reach the sign and read it aloud. “Reptile Petting Zoo 
Whoever heard of a Reptile Petting Zoo! What kind of carnival is this 
anyway?” 

“This carnival is e-evil,” Brad stammers. 

You’re about to agree when you notice the grass in front of you is 
swaying. Something is slithering through it. Something big. And then it 
comes into view. 

“Snake!” Brad cries. 

You know you have to run — but which way? Left or right? 

If you run to the left, turn to PAGE 125 . 

If you run to the right, turn to PAGE 12 . 





61 

You’re too scared to turn around. And too scared not to. Risking a glance 
over your shoulder, you see a large, dark shape behind you. It’s a big man. 

No. You squint hard. It’s dark and hairy with muddy leaves and green vines 
trailing from its body. It’s some sort of swamp monster! 

You run as fast as you can. Your chest is on fire. The swamp monster is 
gaining on you. 

You know you should keep running, but your heart feels as if it’s about to 
explode. You have to stop. 

You turn and stare right into the swamp monster’s bloody eyes. “Neat 
costume,” you say hopefully. 

Good try — but the swamp monster isn’t wearing a costume. He’s real 
and this, unfortunately, is really ... 

THE END 



62 

You decide to wait for Big Al. 

“Big Al has to free the freaks,” you say to Patty and Brad. “If he doesn’t, 
we’ll tell him we’re calling the police!” 

“Free the freaks?” Big Al says, bursting into the room. “The freaks are 
free to go any time. This prison is just part of the show. Did you pull that ‘free 
us’ joke on him?” Big Al laughs heartily. 

“He’ssss lying,” the Snake Lady says. “We’re prisonersssss.” 

“Oh, come now,” Big Al says. “You’re not prisoners.” And with that he 
unlocks all the cell doors. Then he turns to you and your friends. 

“As you can see, the freaks are free. Now, come with me. You haven’t 
even tried one game on the midway.” 

“Don’t go with him. It’sssss a trick!” the Snake Lady cries. 

Should you go with Big Al? 

Who’s telling the truth? Al or the Snake Lady?

Bump. 

A chute opens up. You land headfirst on soft grass. 

You blink several times. A long sigh escapes from your lips. It wasn’t the 
Doom Slide after all. 

As you climb to your feet you hear someone call your name. 

You glance up and shout for joy. It’s Brad! And Patty’s there, too! 

You tell them about your scary ride on the slide — about how you thought 
you’d slide forever. 

“Cool!” Patty exclaims. “Let’s all ride it this time!” 

“No!” you tell her. “This carnival is too weird. And dangerous. 
Something’s not right. We have to get out of here. Now!” 

“Yeah,” Brad agrees. “The faster, the better.” 

“I have an idea,” Patty announces. You and Brad huddle around her. “I 
spotted a back way out of here. But it’s a little risky. We have to squeeze 
through a barbed-wire fence — and it’s guarded by the carnival’s security 
forces. But we should try!” 

Are you going to listen to Patty?

The House of Horrors! You have to see it. You just have to! 

“I’ll catch up with you guys later,” you call to Patty and Brad. “I’m going 
to check out the haunted house.” 

You glance down at your map for directions. The rickety wooden bridge 
over to your left appears to lead straight there. 

As you start across the bridge, the wooden planks creak under your feet. 
Then the bridge begins to sway. You look down. Way down. The bridge spans 
a deep, rocky gorge. Gulping, you grab the handrail. You move slowly. A 
strong wind blows up from the canyon below. The bridge is swaying wildly 
now, tossing from side to side. 

A massive spear of lightning splits the sky. Thunder rumbles so loudly 
you jump and lose your balance. “Help!” you scream as you tumble right over 
the side — and plunge toward the jagged rocks below! 

How can you save yourself? 

Make a grab for the side of the bridge? Turn to PAGE 46 .

65 

The walls are closing in faster now. 

You throw your arms out and try to push them away. But it’s hopeless. 
You’re going to be crushed like a bug. 

You suck in a deep breath — it could be the last breath you take. 

The floor opens beneath your feet! 

You drop down. Down. Down. Down. A long, agonizing scream escapes 
from your throat as you tumble through space. 

Will you ever hit bottom? 

“Incoming player,” you hear a commanding voice shout. “Stations, 
everybody.” 

A layer of webbing catches you like one of those nets trapeze artists use. 
Gasping, unable to understand what’s happening, you bounce up and down. 

Bounce to PAGE 31.

You start up the brick path to the House of Horrors. Suddenly, someone 
sneaks up behind you and taps you on the shoulder. You spin around and 
jump back. 

Standing in front of you is a bony skeleton. 

And it talks. 

“Don’t go in there,” the skeleton says. “Or you’ll end up like me....” 

You stare in terror at the hideous creature. Then you burst out laughing. 

“Wow! You guys really want to make the haunted house totally creepy. 
This is going to be great!” you say. 

You’re still chuckling as you push open the giant oak door of the House of 
Horrors. It swings back with a long, loud creak. 

You step inside and find yourself in a narrow hallway. The door slams 
shut behind you and the hall turns darker than a starless night. “I can’t even 
see my hands!” you exclaim. 

You stumble ahead slowly, pressing your palms against the walls to guide 
you. 

When will this tunnel end? 


Look for a way out on PAGE 80 . 




67 

Thrumpff! Your foot plows into the doctor’s stomach again. But this time, 
it smashes right through it. And hits ... solid steel! 

The crunch of metal echoes in the room — along with the doctor’s 
screams. “Aiiii!” he wails like a siren. 

You gaze into the gaping hole your sneaker made. Thousands of circuits 
and wires burn and crackle inside it. The doctor is a robot! Well, an ex-robot 
now. Your kick totally destroyed him. 

That’s the good news. 

The bad news is headed for you. It’s the monster with the blue horns and 
red, bulging eyes. 

You scramble out of the net and dash toward the door. But the monster is 
too quick for you. His tentacle arms shoot out and snatch you. Giant suckers 
at the ends of his wrists circle your throat. 

You gasp for air as the monster pins you against the wall. Can you free 
yourself from his oozing grasp? 


Try, on PAGE 91 .

You slowly lower yourself onto the slide. You start to stretch out your legs 
when the bottom tilts underneath you and throws you forward. You’re sliding! 
Fast! 

The surface must be made of some kind of special material because 
you’re zooming down at top speed. 

You hold your breath as you fly through the blackness. A bump sends you 
bouncing into the air. You scream. And scream. 

When is it going to end? 

Oh, no! Could this be the Doom Slide? 

You hear screams echo in the darkness. You twist around. But you don’t 
see anyone. 

The ghostly screams grow louder — in front of you, next to you, behind 
you. Screaming and sliding. And sliding. Never stopping. 

You gasp for breath. And then you hear it. 

A voice cuts through the blackness. Through the screams. A voice that 
cries, “Welcome to the rest of your life. Welcome to the Doom Slide!” 


THE END

“Kami marri odonna loma molonu karrano.” You say the magic words 
and — the dummy comes to life! 

He opens his mouth and speaks. “Hey, you. Your face reminds me of a 
wart I once had removed.” 

“Come on,” you plead. “We’re the ones who brought you back to life. 
Aren’t you going to be nice to us? We need your help.” 

“I’m sorry,” the dummy says. “I’m sorry you’re so ugly....” Then he 
laughs at his own lame joke. 

You stare at him and his face grows serious. “You brought me to life,” he 
says slowly, “but now you are my slaves. 

“Forever — until... 

“ THE END .” 

Wait! This isn’t the way this is supposed to end. Quick — you have one 
last chance. If the fortune-teller told you a secret number, go to that page 
now!

“Nine ... ten ...” 

“Brad, shut up. Look at this!” 

You point to the letters on the front of the train car. 

You’ve been staring at them the entire time. Why didn’t you notice them 
before? 

“What about the letters?” Patty says sharply. 

“Eleven ...” 

“Don’t you see what they say?” you shoot back. 

“ 'Right-Way Railroad,’ ” Patty reads. “So what?” 

The chants of the merry-go-round people echo in your head. There’s only 
one right way. There’s only one right way. 

Could it be? 

“Twelve!” 

Now what? 


Turn to PAGE 52. 




71 

Sorry. It’s not your lucky day. As you dash toward the sign, the giant 
crane scoops the three of you up and drops you off into a hollowed-out log. 
You barely have time to sit up straight before the craft reaches the waterfall! 

You hold your breath as the log teeters on the fall’s edge. As it plunges 
over, you scream. 

A hard spray smacks you in the face and drenches your clothing as you 
race down the long slide. At the bottom, the log hits a pool of water and sinks. 

You’re still holding your breath as you wait to bob to the surface again. 
But it never happens. You keep going down. 

Your last thought is that you’re going to set a world’s record for holding 
your breath underwater. 

You’d better set a world’s record for closing the book and starting over 
again. Maybe next time you dive in you’ll have better luck. 


THE END 



72 

You step up to the Guess Your Weight on Mars booth. A woman in a 
space suit motions you inside a gate. You pass through and find yourself in 
the middle of a courtyard that looks just like a miniature launching site — 
complete with its own rocket! 

“Security check,” the lady says as she presses your hand onto a fake 
scanner. 

“So how does this game work?” you ask. 

“I’ll guess how much you weigh on Mars,” she explains. “Then you’ll 
enter the planet simulation chamber and stand on the scale. If I’m stumped by 
more than one pound up or down, you win a giant candy bar.” 

“What if you guess right?” 

The space lady doesn’t say anything at first. She just smiles. A nasty 
smile. Then she answers. 

“You lose,” is all she says. 


Go to PAGE 18. 




73 

Your reflexes are great. You jumped out fast enough and escaped the 
ghost — that ghost. But you didn’t see the other one behind the car — 
waiting for you. 

Your heart hammers away in your chest as it circles you. Around and 
around and around. 

“It’s all right,” you tell yourself over and over. “It’s not real. This is just a 
ride in an amusement park.” 

You’re still telling yourself that as the ghost plucks you off your feet. 

His black lips part. 

He opens his mouth — wider and wider. Until it’s as wide as an entrance 
to a cave. 

Then he stuffs you inside. 

Instantly, you feel lightheaded, then light all over. You peek down at your 
hands. 

You can see straight through them. You’ve been turned into a ghost! And 
as your senses fade, you hear a distant bell chime twelve times. Too bad. The 
Carnival of Horrors will be one of your favorite haunts — forever! 


THE END 



74 

Round and round you go. The world is a blur of colors. You can hear the 
crowd screaming. “FI-NAL! FI-NAL!” 

And the wheel stops. 

“Ahhhhhh,” the crowd gasps. 

What does it mean? 

“YOU WIN,” Big A1 says. “Now come this way to collect your prize and 
go home.” 

Turn to PAGE 131. 




75 


The three of you duck inside the Hall of the Mountain King! 

A painted backdrop of rounded, snowcapped mountains rises on your left. 
Up in the mountains, a big stone castle rests in the sunshine. A group of 
cheerful elves picks flowers in the castle’s garden. 

To your right, you spot the ride — wooden carts pulled by real horses. 
“Come on!” you call to your friends. “Jump in a cart. This is great. We’ll be 
out of here in no time.” No time — that reminds you. You glance at your 
watch. 11:45! 

You all scramble into one of the carts and grab the reins. Your horse plods 
forward, and you pass through a painted stone archway. 

You gasp. Everything in the painted backdrop is now in front of you. And 
it has suddenly become real. But different! 

The snowcapped mountains rise to black, jagged peaks that pierce the sky. 
The big stone castle huddles on a scary, dark hill. And the elves — they aren’t 
picking flowers. 

They’re ...

76 

You dig deep into the side pocket of your jeans — and find it! The 
chocolate bar you won. 

It’s a good thing you didn’t eat it all — but will the vulture go for it? 

Without warning, the big bird starts his final approach, diving straight for 
the nest. You pull out the candy and wave it frantically in front of him. “Treat! 
Treat!” you holler. These words make your dog at home go wild. But will it 
work on the vulture? 

Yes! He cracks open his claws — just enough for you to wiggle loose. 
Then you’re falling, falling. 

You’ve landed on a giant trampoline. 

Fwangggl 

Now you’re going up again. Higher this time. Now you’re falling again. 

Fwanggg — you’ve bounced up even higher this time. 

Every life has its ups and downs, but it looks as if you’ll be bouncing up 
and down forever — and boy, is it fun! 

THE END ! 

THE END ! 

THE END! 


THE END! 






77 

“Let’s head for the midway and play some games!” you say. 

You, Patty, and Brad jog down a wide avenue. Tents of every color line 
the street. Carnival music blares from loudspeakers. 

You spot a green neon sign flashing above a yellow-striped tent. The sign 
reads: madame zeno — fortune-teller. 

“Excellent!” you exclaim. “I’m going in!” 

You tell your friends you’ll catch up with them in a minute. 

You lift the tent flap. Inside, one small candle flickers in the dark. You 
hear a low voice call out, “Enter my chamber.” 

There is Madame Zeno, sitting in the shadows. She wears a long red dress 
dotted with brightly colored gems. They shimmer in the candlelight. Her 
black hair tumbles to her shoulders as she bends over a large crystal ball. 

“Welcome,” she whispers. Then she reaches out and gently lifts your 
hand. “Let me tell you your future.” 


To find your future, go to PAGE 78 . 




78 

Madame Zeno studies your hand closely. She traces the lines in your hand 
with her soft fingers. 

“I see horror in your future. In your immediate future,” she warns. 

“Wh-what kind of horror?” you stammer. “What do you mean?” 

Madame Zeno releases your hand. She picks up a strange deck of cards. 
She spreads them out on the table. You notice the cards have pictures — a 
headless man, a bloody sword, a large, evil eye. 

She gathers up all the cards and flips the deck over. Then she deals out a 
red card and a blue card. 

“Turn one over,” she commands. “Learn your fate.” 

Pick red? Go to PAGE 14 . 

Pick blue? Go to PAGE 59. 





79 


The doctor leans over. He’s so close now, his sour breath fills your 
nostrils. Then his fingertips brush your hand and — POW! Your foot flies into 
his stomach! A direct hit! 

But nothing happens. 

He doesn’t scream. He doesn’t even moan. In fact, he doesn’t seem to 
notice at all. 

He simply smiles at you. 

Now you’re scared. Really scared. But you know you have to do whatever 
it takes to get out of there. You have to find your friends and escape from this 
Carnival of Horrors. 

You gather up every ounce of courage and strength you have — and kick 
him once more. Harder! 

And this time something does happen — BIG TIME! 


Turn to PAGE 67 to find out what. 




80 

You turn a corner and are instantly blinded by glaring lights. 

You are standing in a room of mirrors. Walls. Floor. Ceiling. All mirrors! 

Everywhere you gaze, you are met with reflections of yourself! You take 
a few steps forward and — BONK! You hit your head on solid glass. 

You move one step to the left, and a dozen copies of you move in that 
direction. 

Totally dizzy, you close your eyes. Maybe you can find the exit with your 
hands. Keeping your eyes shut, you walk until your palms hit against another 
glass wall. Then you hear a voice. “Come this way. Over here,” it calls. 

You walk toward the voice — BONK — a solid wall again. 

Finally, your hands find an open doorway! It leads to a mirrored hallway 
that goes left and right. Which way will you go? 

If you decide to turn right, go to PAGE 29 . 

If you decide to turn left, go to PAGE 118 . 





81 

“You’re lying!” you yell. “You are a robot.” 

You quickly reach up with both hands and tug at his head. His sharp jaws 
slash at you. But you’re fast. You hold on firmly and pull! 

Oh, no! He really is a monster. And he’s not happy. 

You know you’re dead meat, but you have to try one more time. Just to 
make sure. You give his head one more tug. He laughs. Then he gives your 
head a tug. 

Sorry. You were doing so well. But now you’ve gone and lost your head. 
The only way you’ll be able to face the challenge of the Carnival of Horrors 
now is to close the book and begin another day. At least then — you’ll have a 
head start. 

THE END 



82 

“Oooopah lupah dummie dupah.” You say the magic words and wait for 
the dummy to spring to life. 

And you wait. 

And you wait. 

The dummy remains the same. 

But something strange is happening to you. What are those feathers 
sprouting out of your skin? And what’s happening to your feet? Are those 
claws you see growing out of them? 

Is it possible that the magic words are turning you — CLUCK — into a 
— CL UCK — chicken? 

That’s eggs-actly what’s happening. 

Well, you laid an egg this time. Let’s hope you won’t be too chicken to 
open this book again and try once more to escape from the Carnival of 
Horrors. 


THE END 

83 

You squint hard at the road ahead of you — and see why Patty wants you 
to turn. There they are — the people in the old-fashioned clothes. Only they 
don’t look the same. 

Some have green flesh. Some are deathly white. Their rotting skin hangs 
from their bones. 

And they’re all reaching out. Reaching out for you! 

“Turn! Turn!” Patty yells. 

You spin the wheel sharply to the left to avoid them. But you can’t dodge 
the ghostly creature that’s rising above you. He’s ten feet tall — with arms so 
long that they scrape the ground. His mouth gapes open to reveal hundreds of 
blackened, rotting teeth. 

He swoops down at you. You turn the steering wheel hard to the right. 
Too hard — it comes off in your hands! 

“Jump!” you cry. “Jump and run! Run!” 

The three of you leap out of the moving car. But are you fast enough? 
That depends on how good your reflexes are. 

Try this test and find out. Throw a ball in the air. Try to clap three times 
before you catch it. 


If you can do it — turn to PAGE 73 . 
If you couldn ’t — turn to PAGE 127 . 





84 

Big A1 shoves you and your friends into a huge red tent. It seems to be set 
up for some kind of show. Red carpeted steps lead up to a platform, which sits 
under a golden arch. The arch twinkles with a thousand colored lights that 
spell out: FINAL CHALLENGE. 

Trumpets blast as people flood into the viewing area. As they march in, 
they clap their hands and yell, “FI-NAL. FI-NAL.” 

Big A1 leads you up the carpeted steps. You are standing on the platform 
now — in front of a shimmering curtain that hangs down from the arch. 

The crowd begins to chant, “SUD-DEN DEATH. SUD-DEN DEATH.” 

“What do you think that means?” Patty asks. 

You’re going to find out on PAGE 123 . 




85 

The giant hangs over you, flexing his muscles. He squints at you as if you 
are a bug — ready to be squashed. 

“Did you call me a wimp?” he thunders. 

You are much too scared to answer. 

The giant answers for you. “You’re right. I am a wimp!” 

And with that, he bends the bars, and you, Patty, and Brad scramble 
through. 

“Follow me,” the giant says. “I know a way out of here.” 

“What about the others?” you ask, pointing to the freaks in the cells that 
line the wall. 

“No problem!” Patty yells, grabbing the keys from a hook on the wall. 
“Here — catch!” 

You quickly unlock all the doors — setting the freaks free! 


Turn to PAGE 126. 




86 

“I don’t know,” you say. “I don’t think we should take any more risks. 
Especially not in this crazy carnival.” 

“Don’t you trust me?” Patty demands. Her eyes flash angrily. 

You glance at Brad. He stares at the ground. 

“I just have a bad feeling about this, Patty. Okay?” 

But Patty doesn’t answer. She throws her shoulders back and stands up 
taller. And taller. And taller. 

You gasp! Patty is growing! She’s nearly ten feet tall! 

She reaches out a long arm and grabs you by the wrist. Her nails dig deep 
into your skin. 

You can’t move. 

You scream as Patty continues to change. Her skin turns green and lumpy. 
Horns sprout from her head. And her teeth grow into sharp fangs. 

You remember the horrible monsters on the walls of the slide. Patty has 
turned into one of them! 

“Let me go. Please!” you plead. 

“Too bad you didn’t trust me,” she growls. “I can’t have you ruining my 
plans.” Her nails sink deeper into your flesh. 

“Ha-ha-ha!” she cackles. Then she wraps her slimy mouth around your 
arm and bites down. Hard! 


THE END 



87 

You’re staring at a sign that reads: world’s freakiest freak show! The 
three of you gape at the pictures. 

There’s the Three-Headed Man with the ugliest collection of faces you’ve 
ever seen. And the Snake Lady — a young blond girl with a beautiful face 
and the body of a slithering snake. 

“This is, uh — uh —” you start to say. But you don’t finish. Because a 
large hand has come down on your shoulder. Hard. 

You slowly turn and gaze up at a huge man with shoulders wider than a 
refrigerator. He has coal-black eyes with a thick mustache to match. He looks 
strong enough — and mean enough — to pitch you over the fence with one 
hand. 

“What are you doing?” his deep voice booms. “You’re not allowed in 
here,” he says, pointing directly at you. 

“We’re sorry,” you say, hoping you appear sorry and not just scared. “We 
wanted to look around. That’s all. But we’ll leave. Right now.” 

His eyes stare into yours. He clamps both hands down on your shoulders 
and says, “You’re not going anywhere!” 


Uh-oh. Quick! Better turn to PAGE 4 . 


88 

You head toward the Boat Trip to Nowhere. At the dock, you spot a 
stubby guy with long arms slouching against one of the mooring posts. In the 
strange light of the swamp, his skin shines with an oily, green glow. And his 
ears and nose are as craggy as tree bark. 

“Step right up,” he calls in a gravelly voice. 

He pulls one of the motorboats over. It’s red with a silver racing stripe! 
“You can do fifteen knots in these babies,” he says. “But stay away from the 
tree stumps.” 

You watch the little man’s sharp green fingernails tearing the mooring 
rope apart. As soon as the boat is free, you jump in, step on the gas, and roar 
away from the dock. 

The wind blows hard against your face. You’re flying over the water. This 
is totally cool! You head for a channel that you see up ahead. Too bad you 
didn’t notice that sign that reads: toboogerbog. 


Enter the bog on PAGE 32 . 




89 

Dr. Stone extends a long bony hand to pull you from the net. When you 
peer into his face, his eyes roll up into his head. 

“Pleased to meet you,” he rumbles. 

Did he say, “Pleased to meet you” or “Pleased to eat you”? You’re not 
sure, and you don’t want to hang around to find out. 

I’ve got to get out of here, you think. 

As the doctor lowers his hand a bit more, you wriggle your right foot free 
of the netting. If you give him one hard kick in the stomach, maybe you can 
make a run for the door. 

But what about the monsters? Can you dodge them? 

You change your mind. “I’ll wait — play it cool until at least one of the 
beasts leaves the room,” you say to yourself. 

Then you change your mind again. “No. I’d better make my escape now!” 

The doctor looms inches away. And you’re still not sure what to do. 

You’d better decide fast! 

Try to kick the doctor and run ? Turn to PAGE 79 . 

Wait until one of the monsters leaves and the odds are better than three 
against one? Turn to PAGE 51 . 





90 

NO! 

At the last minute, you wrench the steering wheel hard to the left. The 
side of your boat clears the tree with a sickening scrape. 

You breathe a sigh of relief, but it ends in a groan. A huge, sharp root 
below the water has just ripped into the bottom of your boat. You hear a 
tearing sound, then gurgling as the cockpit starts to fill with water. 

“Now what?” you mutter. 

Then through the mist you spot another boat. But it’s some distance away. 

“Hey, over here!” you cry out. 

Did they hear you? You cry out again. Then you glance behind you. More 
than half your boat is underwater — and you’re going down fast. 

What should you do? Keep yelling for help? Or try to swim for safety? 
Make your choice — QUICK! 


If you decide to wait to be rescued, go to PAGE 100 . 
If you decide to swim for it, go to PAGE 56 . 





91 

The red-eyed beast leans against you now, pressing you hard against the 
wall. The monster moves his face close to yours. The jagged horns at the top 
of his head nick your cheeks. 

You can’t bear it anymore. You bring your hand up with all your might 
and shove his head away from yours. 

As you watch in horror, the monster’s head rolls off its neck. The head 
tumbles to the floor and lands at your feet. 

The eyes glance up at you, and you notice his hideous lips moving. “That 
hurt,” the head says. “That really h-h- ...” 

He never finishes. You’ve destroyed another robot! 

“Almost out of here,” you whisper to yourself. Now all you have to do is 
slip by the crusty, alligator-snout creature guarding the door. 

“You robots aren’t so tough,” you say to him with fake bravery. 

“Oh, really?” the scaly beast croaks. “Well, maybe not. But what makes 
you think that / am a robot?” 


Turn to PAGE 122 




92 

You decide to wait. Someone should be here soon, you think. But after 
waiting in the space shuttle for at least fifteen minutes, you’re not so sure. No 
one has shown up to rescue you. 

A chill runs down your back. You feel as if a thousand pairs of eyes are 
watching you from the shadows. 

Now that you’re accustomed to the darkness, you can see dozens of tracks 
leading in and out of the tunnel. 

And then you hear a rustling sound. You freeze. You listen hard. Could it 
be rats — or something worse? 

You draw up your knees and wrap your arms around them tightly. Then 
you hear a hissing sound — and you smell something odd. It’s kind of a sweet 
smell — like heavy perfume. You hold your nose because the smell is making 
you feel strange. Dizzy. Sick. 


Hold your breath and turn to PAGE 20 . 




93 


What a sight! 

You can hardly believe your eyes! 

You scream again. 

It’s Patty and Brad! 

“Hey, guys, wait up!” you yell. 

Quick! Hurry to PAGE 26 and you can go on the Space Coaster with 
them. 




94 

The ride stops. 

Dead. 

You are sitting in the dark. 

Nothing is moving. 

“Patty! Brad!” you call. 

Silence. 

Why don’t they answer? They have to be there. 

You try to twist around. But you’re locked in your harness and clamped in 
your headrest. 

Blinking in the dim light, your eyes dart to the left. Then to the right. You 
spot dozens of empty space rockets lining the walls. They seem to come in 
sections, making longer and shorter space rockets. 

Your mind starts working feverishly. Did your section detach from Patty 
and Brad’s section? 

Suddenly, the silence is shattered. Your seat lock grinds open, and you are 
released from your harness. You quickly spin around. Patty’s and Brad’s cars 
have disappeared! If this is all part of the ride, maybe you should hop out. But 
if the ride is broken, maybe you should wait for help. 

Wait for help to come? Turn to PAGE 92 . 

Hop out of the car? Go to PAGE 111 . 





95 

You sit down on the slide and push off. The world tilts as you plunge 
down. Down, down, down. 

You’re scared. But you can’t help feeling that this is kind of cool! Sliding 
and swirling in the darkness. 

Until you hear the screams. The eerie screams that follow you as you 
twist and turn. 

Your heart starts pounding wildly. Oh, no! You must have picked the 
Doom Slide. You’re going to slide forever! 

And then, bump. 

A chute opens up. You hit the ground hard. You tumble over and over and 
finally stop. 

You lie on the ground. Panting. 

You’re outside! 

You scramble to your feet and gaze around. 

You hear laughter. It seems to be coming from the bright pink building a 
few feet in front of you. 

You walk over to its big pink door and press your ear against it. 

Yes. The laughter is definitely coming from inside. 


To find out what’s so funny, turn to PAGE 117 . 




96 

... they’re swinging axes. 

Your heart leaps into your throat. The elves move to the roadside now — 
and they’re chopping down the horse-drawn carts ahead of you! One cart 
splinters into a million pieces before your horrified eyes. 

The elves continue on to the next cart. Their sharp blades slice right 
through it! 

Your horse keeps trotting up the steep path. You’re headed right for the 
wildly chopping elves! 

“Do something!” Patty cries. 

Turn to PAGE 23. 




97 

Your hand clamps around the can of Monster Blood in your pocket. 
Quickly, you snap off the lid and the green gunk pours out. 

“Look! It’s alive!” Brad shouts. 

He’s right. The Monster Blood oozes from the can, quivers, and appears 
to stretch and pull itself up! Then it starts to roll and bounce, making horrible 
sucking sounds. 

Great! It’s rolling into the crowd, sucking up everything in its path! 

“Run!” Big A1 screams as the huge green ball rolls over the people in the 
crowd — sucking them up with a loud plop. 

Then the Monster Blood hits the side of the tent. It changes direction. 

It’s coming after you! 

Hurry to PAGE 129 . 




98 

Well, looks can fool you. He is not a wimp. 

And he’s mad — at you. 

In the next moment, he scoops you up and hurls you at the cell wall. His 
throw is so forceful, you smash right through the wall and soar out of the 
carnival grounds. 

Congratulations! You escaped the Carnival of Horrors — but not in one 
piece. 

THE END 



99 

“Okay, get me out of here,” you say to the dwarf. “Did you help my 
friends, too?” 

The dwarf does not answer. He sprints off and you have to race to keep up 
with him. Through a confusing maze of twisting tunnels. You’re sure glad you 
have a guide. 

The dwarf suddenly stops. “That way,” he says gruffly, pointing straight 
ahead. 

Before you can blink, he vanishes in a puff of smoke! And you’re left 
standing in front of two doors. One red. One blue. The red one has a sign that 
reads: danger. The blue one has a sign that reads: big danger. 

If you leave by the red door, go to PAGE 104 . 

If you try the blue door, go to PAGE 57 .

“Help! Help! Over here!” you scream, waving your arms wildly in the air. 

“Hold on!” a deep voice answers through the heavy mist. 

The boat turns and speeds toward you. As it nears, the voice calls out 
again. “Jump! Jump over!” 

Jump? Is he crazy? Can you really jump onto a moving boat? 

The boat is coming closer now. Closer. Closer. You stand up. You bend 
your knees. You’re about to jump — and the boat speeds right past you. 

But wait! It is circling back now in a nice, slow approach. It glides up to 
you, and gigantic hands pull you onto the boat. 

“You saved me!” you cry. 

You gaze up and gasp in surprise. The man in the other boat isn’t a man 
— it’s a monster with a drooling snout and rows of jagged teeth. 

“Save you? Save you?” the monster repeats. 

His red eyes light up. “Save you ... good idea,” he says. “I won’t eat you 
now. I’ll save you for a midnight snack!” 


THE END (Burp!) 



101 

You make it! You make it out of the park! 

You also make it out of the state! 

In fact, the last time anyone saw you, Patty, and Brad, you were all a tiny 
blip on NASA’s radar screen. 

Congratulations! You escaped from the Carnival of Horrors. 

Happy landings! 

THE END 



102 

“I’m not going anywhere with you, Big Al. I believe the Snake Lady!” 

“So do I,” says Patty. 

“Me, too!” Brad echoes. 

“That’s too bad,” Big Al says. Then he turns to the Snake Lady. 

“And as for you, Miss Reptilia — I told you, you’ve been overacting. If 
these kids believe you, we won’t be able to torture them with our real 
horrors.” 

“Ssssssorry, bosssssss,” she says. “Sssssso what do you want me to do 
with them?” 

You can hardly believe it! Real horrors? 

“What kind of carnival is this?” you shout. 

“The Carnival of Horrorssssss,” the Snake Lady answers — and that’s the 
good news. 


Turn to PAGE 120 for the bad news. 




103 

“We’ve got to jump,” you tell Patty and Brad. “It’s our only chance.” 

“Okay,” Brad agrees as your cart inches up to the chopping elves. 

“Come on,” you cry. “Now!” But Brad is too paralyzed with fear to move. 
You and Patty grab him and haul him toward the side of the cart. 

Your cart has reached the elves! One of them smirks as he lifts his ax. 

It’s right above your neck. 

You picture your head tumbling down the side of the mountain. 

With a loud cry, all three of you jump. You land with a thud on a rocky 
ledge. It breaks your fall. But the rock is too weak to hold all of you. 

You scream again as the edge tears loose and the world drops from under 
your feet. You tumble over and over, down the side of the mountain. 

Go to PAGE 109. 




104 

You push open the red door. Another tunnel lies beyond it. You follow its 
twists and turns, and you realize that you’re sloshing through cold muddy 
water. It grows deeper and chillier as you go. 

With a cold shudder, you decide to head back — until you hear a slurping 
noise behind you. Whirling around, you watch in horrible fascination as giant 
earthworms crawl out of the mud. Gross! 

No way you’re heading back there. You clench your teeth and slog 
onward. Up ahead, you see a dim green light. Great! An exit. 

As you reach the end of the tunnel, you hear a low growl behind you. At 
first you try to pretend it’s your imagination. But there’s no mistaking the 
sound of thudding footsteps. Getting closer. And closer. And now it’s 
breathing down your neck! 

Go to PAGE 61. 




105 

It’s a tree branch! Grabbing at you. Tugging, tugging at your hair. You 
can’t break free. Its gnarly stubs dig in deeper as you struggle. 

Suddenly, you feel something wrap itself around your arms. Then your 
legs. Closing in tighter. Tighter. 

You gaze down and see them — black knobby tree limbs twisting around 
you. Strangling you. 

You drop hold of the steering wheel and begin to claw at the branches, 
ripping them away. 

And then you peer up — and see a terrifying sight. It’s a huge tree. And 
you’re headed straight for it! You grasp the steering wheel to regain control of 
the boat. The tree is just inches away. 

Are you going to CRASH?! 

Turn to PAGE 90. 




106 

“Unless what?” you scream. “Tell me!” 

“You can escape the Carnival of Horrors if you leave before closing 
time.” 

“When is closing time?” you shoot back. 

“When the last ride stops....” the lady whispers. “At midnight. ” 

You glance at your watch — 11:40. Twenty minutes — that’s not so bad. 
But how do you get out of here? 

As if the lady can read your mind, she says, “There’s only one right way.” 

Then all around you, the crowd begins to chant. 

“ONLY ONE RIGHT WAY, ONLY ONE RIGHT WAY.” They repeat it 
over and over again. 

“What is it?” you scream. “Which way?” 

It’s useless. They’re not going to tell you. 

But it’s not midnight yet. There’s still time to figure it out. 

Until the floor begins to tremble. And the walls begin to shake. 
Earthquake! 


Turn to PAGE 42. 




107 

“Sorry, Brad. I think Patty’s right,” you tell him as you turn toward the 
Hall of the Mountain King. “I think I spotted an exit there when we first came 
in.” 

Patty runs ahead. “Look!” she cries out. “There’s the path. It leads past 
the Hall of the Mountain King to the exit.” 

“Yeah, but who are those people up there?” Brad asks. “They’re blocking 
the way.” 

You peer up ahead and see them — the people in the old-fashioned 
clothes. And they’re still chanting — “Only one right way, only one right 
way. ” 

“They’re not going to let us out!” Brad panics. 

“Okay. Okay. I have an idea,” you say calmly. “Let’s go into the Mountain 
King ride — maybe we can jump off at the end and sneak past them.” 

Do you have another choice? No.

“We’ve got to get out of here, it’s almost midnight,” you say as you run 
toward the Halloween Express ride. 

“Hey, maybe we should try one of these cars,” Brad says, pointing to the 
red and orange cars that run on a track. 

The three of you crowd into a little car that’s really meant for two. You 
jam your foot on the gas pedal, and you’re flying! 

“All right!” Brad cheers. “We’re on our way home! Hey, I wonder why 
they call this Halloween Express?” he asks. 

You turn the wheel sharply to the left, and then you know why.... 

Speed over to PAGE 54 . 




109 

You squeeze your eyes shut and wait for the crash. Finally, you land. You 
glance up. You’re at the foot of the Log Flume ride. 

You, Patty, and Brad have lots of cuts and bruises, but you’re okay! 
Terrific! you think — until you spot the army of elves with their axes. They’re 
rushing down the mountain toward you! The only escape is to enter the flume 
ride, so you dash inside. 

The Log Flume reminds you of a western logging camp, complete with 
log cabins, trees, trucks, and a sparkling blue lake. 

In the distance, you can hear the buzz of chain saws. And down by the 
lake, giant cranes pick up logs and plop them in the water. Some of the logs 
are hollowed out in the middle with seats for passengers. As you watch, the 
current catches one. It glides to the edge of a waterfall, plunges over, and 
shoots down. 

As you glance around, you spot an exit sign. 

Then to your horror, you see a giant crane swinging your way. “Duck!” 
you scream. 

Will you make it to the exit? Is this your lucky day?

Something tells you that this monster is not a robot. This one is for real. 
Maybe it’s the way he stares into your eyes. Or maybe it’s the rows and rows 
of razor-sharp teeth jutting from his mouth. 

You take a step back. He takes a step closer. A drop of his drool drips on 
your hand. It sizzles and burns. 

This is the end, you figure. You’ll never escape the Carnival of Horrors. 
Never see your family or Patty and Brad again. 

The monster lifts his gigantic, clawed hand. He waves it over your head. 
And you wait for the searing pain as it plunges down to strike you. 

But that’s not what happens. 

The monster slowly lowers his hand and clutches at his own neck, and 
then — pulls his own head off! And when you discover what’s underneath, 
you know you’re still in big trouble! 


Quick — head over to PAGE 133 . 




111 

Your pulse pounds in your ears as you carefully lift yourself out of the car. 
The tunnel is dark and musty and really creepy. Anything could be lurking in 
the shadows. 

This must be part of the ride, you reason. And the more you think about it, 
the more convinced you are. You’re scared. But you have to admit, this is 
pretty cool. 

In the distance, you spot several red lights that seem to lead to other dimly 
lit tunnels. You cautiously head toward one of them. Overhead something 
dark and slimy drips. Splattering on the top of your head. Stinging your 
forehead. 

As you desperately try to wipe the burning slime away, something grabs 
you by the knees! 

Aaaah! You look down. A pair of red-rimmed eyes meet yours. It’s a 
dwarf with scraggly red hair and a toothless smile. 

“Want me to lead you out of here, kid?” he asks. You’re about to follow 
the dwarf, but then you stop. Is he part of the ride? He looks really evil. What 
do you do? 

Follow the dwarf? Go to PAGE 99 . 

Decide not to follow the dwarf? Go to PAGE 33 . 





112 

Yeoow! Someone splashes cold water in your face. Your eyes open. 

“Come on! Wake up! It’s almost show time,” a raspy voice says. 

“Show time?” you say, gazing into the eyes of a dwarf. “What show?” 

“The Freak Show. You are the Amazing Siamese Triplets.” 

You glance around and see Patty on one side of you and Brad on the other. 
You try to pull away from them, but you can’t. 

“We’re stuck together with some kind of glue,” Patty says. 

“It isn’t glue,” Brad argues. 

“Is too!” 

“Is not!” 

Well, whatever it is — you are stuck. Stuck between your arguing friends 
for a long, long time — like forever. And here’s something you can’t argue 
about. This really is ... 


THE END 



113 

Help some freaks? That’s a good one! You laugh. 

You think about Madame Zeno, the fire, and the disappearing tent. Totally 
cool! You wonder who thought up such awesome special effects. 

You can’t wait to tell Brad and Patty all about it. 

You search for your friends in the big wooden booths that line the 
midway. Instead, you find incredible games of chance. Some test your eye- 
hand coordination. Others require pure luck. But they all offer the most 
amazing prizes you’ve ever seen — phones, video games, fifteen-speed 
mountain bikes. You can’t wait to play! 

You spot a booth across the midway with a crowd gathered in front. 

That’s odd, you think. Didn’t Big A1 say we were the only people at the 
carnival tonight? You wonder if your friends are in the crowd. You move 
closer. 

“Oh. I get it,” you say aloud. “These people must work at the carnival.” 

You’re about to call out to them. Until you see their eyes. Strange, 
haunted eyes. 


See what happens on PAGE 16 . 




114 

This is your lucky day. 

You duck as the crane swings over your head. 

“Run!” you shout to your friends. 

You glance at your watch — 11:55. If you’re really lucky, you can still 
make it out of the carnival by midnight. 

You can see the exit up ahead. As you charge through the gate, you feel 
really hopeful — until you run into Big Al. 

He blocks the exit with his huge body. His massive hands are planted on 
his hips. “No one escapes from the Carnival of Horrors!” he roars. 

You’ve got to find a way out. Now! 

To your right is the entrance to Halloween Express — you could try that. 

Or maybe you should run down a different path. There’s got to be more 
exits around here somewhere. 

Choose fast! 

Run down a different path? Go to PAGE 5 .

115 

There’s nothing in your pocket but lint. 

“Help! Save me!” you cry. 

The vulture swoops down and drops you in the nest. 

The baby vultures approach. 

Mouths open — ready to peck you to death ... 

But — good news! They don’t eat you. You fall out of the nest instead. 

Please, close the book fast, or the next sound you hear will be your body, 
hitting the ground with an awesome thud. 

THUD! 

Not fast enough. Okay, don’t go to pieces. Pull yourself together and 
prepare to visit the Carnival of Horrors again — the next time you’re brave 
enough to open this book! 


THE END 



116 

ZAP! 

Big A1 throws a switch and the magnet shuts off. You come flying down 
to earth — right where Brad and Patty are waiting. 

“I played your dumb game. Now, let us go!” you tell Big Al. 

Big Al doesn’t answer. But the crowd does. “SUD-DEN DEATH! SUD¬ 
DEN DEATH! SUD-DEN DEATH!” 

The crowd surges toward you. They are not friendly. They back you up 
against a wall. You’re trapped. 

Trapped by a mob! 

You reach into your pocket, hoping to find something that might help you. 
Something to save you ... 


If you won a can of Monster Blood, go to PAGE 97 . 

If you don’t have the Monster Blood, run to PAGE 27 . 





117 

You open the door and enter a room bursting with people who seem to be 
waiting for you. You think that’s weird until you study them — and realize 
something even stranger. They’re all dressed up in old-fashioned costumes. 

“Welcome to the Carnival of Horrors,” a tall woman with a red parasol 
says, smiling. “Nice of you to join us.” 

The Carnival of Horrors. The words send shivers down your spine. 

The woman with the parasol whispers in your ear, “Don’t you want to 
know the secret of the Carnival of Horrors?” 

You nod yes. 

“The Carnival of Horrors comes alive in a different place and a different 
time each night. Tonight we’re in your town. Tomorrow we could be in 
another country! But every place we stop, we invite kids like you to join 
us....” 

“Thanks for the invitation,” you say, “but I gotta go.” 

“I’m sorry.” The lady chuckles. “You can never escape from the Carnival 
of Horrors,” she says solemnly. “Unless ...” 


Unless what? Turn to PAGE 106. 




118 

You turn left. Somewhere ahead of you, you hear laughter. 

“Is somebody there?” you call out. 

Silence. 

You stare at your reflections in the mirrored hall. 

Am I trapped? you wonder. Am I in real danger? Or is this all a big, scary 
joke? Your heart begins to race. 

You inch forward a few more steps — moving toward the laughter. 
Slowly. 

“Over here,” a voice calls again. But now the voice seems to be coming 
from behind you! 

Turn to PAGE 36 . 

HELP! 




119 

You take charge of the reins to urge the horse on. 

“Giddyap, boy,” you and Patty shout. But your horse won’t move any 
faster. 

You shoot a glance up ahead. The elves are chopping ... and a shiny blade 
... is now ... right over ... your head! 

“No,” you scream. “NO! Let me out of here.” 

You feel a sharp pain. And you realize you’ve just had the shortest haircut 
of your life. Unfortunately, they took a little too much off the top. 

THE END 



120 

The bad news is the Snake Lady fooled you. 

“Throw them into the large cell with Harold and all the other prisoners,” 
Big A1 commands. 

You are shoved into a dark cell. You hear a click. You’re locked in. As the 
Snake Lady leaves with Big Al, you can hear their laughter echo down the 
hall. 

You glance into the other cells and think, the freaks are prisoners. They 
do need our help. Then you peer into the darkness of your cell — to find out 
who Harold is. 

There’s no way you could miss him. Harold is a giant. He’s huge — twice 
as big as a football player. His hands are, in fact, the size of two footballs. His 
arms look like tree trunks. 

At first you are afraid of him, but then you think, Hey! He’s trapped, too. 
Maybe we can convince him to help us. And then you get a big idea! 


Turn to PAGE 28. 




121 

You grab the sides of the slide and lower yourself down. The second you 
sit, the slide’s floor tilts up beneath you and propels you forward. 

You shriek! 

You raise your arms and scream louder. You slide faster and faster. In total 
darkness. Darkness so black, you can’t even see your own feet in front of you. 

Your eyes dart frantically from side to side. Faces suddenly appear in the 
darkness in bright flashes of light. Faces of hideous monsters with deformed 
heads and oozing flesh. 

But you’re moving too fast to focus on them. You slide and slide — until 
the faces stop flashing and you’re covered in the thick, heavy blackness again. 

You scream as you round a sharp curve. Your head is spinning. You pick 
up speed. 

When will it end? 

Then you hear the screams. Chilling screams that echo through the 
darkness. 

Oh, no! You must have picked the Doom Slide! 


Zoom to PAGE 63. 




122 

The creature slides one step toward you, and with a burning stare says, “I 
am not a robot. I am not going to shut down. So don’t bother with any of your 
silly, human tricks!” 

You stare at him. You study him hard. Is he lying? Is he a robot like the 
other two? Or could he be a lot more dangerous? 

Your knees begin to tremble when you think about never going home — 
never seeing your family and friends ever again. Tears start to sting your eyes. 
Angry tears! No carnival — not even a Carnival of Horrors — is going to 
defeat you! 

You stare deeply into the evil eyes of the creature hovering before you. 
Robot? Real monster? You finally decide! 

If you think the creature is a robot, try to knock his head off on PAGE 

81 . 

If you think he’s a real monster or something worse, stay cool on PAGE 
110. 






123 

“The Final Challenge,” Big A1 announces. And the crowd goes wild. 

Then he turns to you and says, “Remember — the fun games are over. 
Now you are playing for your life.” 

“You go first,” Big A1 says to you. You see Brad and Patty taken off to the 
side by a huge man in a black hood. 

Two red-haired dwarfs in clown costumes scurry up the steps. To your 
surprise, they fit you with new high-top sneakers — sneakers with metal studs 
running up the backs. This is going to be some kind of race, you think. But 
then you change your mind — when they snap a heavy, metal helmet on your 
head. 

The crowd’s cheers grow louder. Big A1 throws a switch. The curtain 
behind you parts and — Whammo! The wall behind the curtain turns into a 
super magnet. You go zinging to the wall like a dart to a bull’s-eye. 


Zing back to PAGE 25 . 




124 

“FI-NAL! FI-NAL! FI-NAL!” you hear the crowd yelling as you spin 
round and round. 

You’re getting dizzy. Really dizzy. So dizzy that you faint. 

Your eyes flutter open on PAGE 112 . 




125 


“This way!” You wave to Patty and Brad. 

The three of you turn to the left and keep running — straight into a pond! 

“Why didn’t you tell us to stop?” Patty whines. 

“Don’t complain to me!” you shout back. “We followed you through the 
fence!” 

You turn around and slog your way back to shore. Patty and Brad make it 
there first. You are a few feet away — when you see it. 

An alligator. 

With its mouth gaping open — revealing two rows of razor-sharp teeth. 

You freeze. 

Patty spots the alligator and yells, “Quick! There’s a log! Jump on it!” 

You scramble up on the log, but it’s no use. You’re still an easy target. 

The alligator opens its huge mouth even wider. He slithers right up to the 
log. And you can tell he’s ready. Ready to crunch down on you! 


Don’t scream yet. Turn to PAGE 43 . 




126 

“Yay! Our hero!” the freaks cheer as they bolt out of their cells. 

You follow the giant through a side exit. And in no time, you’re leading 
all your new friends to your house. 

You’re sure your parents won’t mind taking them in. After all, how much 
can a three-hundred-pound giant, a five-hundred-pound fat lady, and a three¬ 
headed man eat? Hmmmm. Better not answer that question. 

Just be happy that you’ve come to ... 

THE END 



127 

You’re not fast enough to get away from the ghost. You’re running now, 
but the ghost swoops down in front of you. You plow into him — and pass 
right through him! 

The carnival people are swarming after you. They don’t want you to leave 
the carnival. 

“Hurry!” you yell to your friends — only three minutes to midnight! You 
dash off in one direction, then another. The carnival people are approaching 
from every which way. They carry torches with flames that leap high in the 
air. 

You steal a glance at your watch — 11:58. 

“We can’t let them catch us!” you scream. “Let’s hide!” 

But where can you hide? Up ahead you see a gigantic cannon. All three of 
you could fit easily in there. 

You also spot a baby ride — the baby choo-choo train — maybe you 
could squeeze into that. 

Quick! Pick one — and hope for the best. 

Cannon ? Go to PAGE 130 . 

Choo-choo? Go to PAGE 128. 





128 

You squeeze into the choo-choo and scrunch down. 11:59. 

Lights from the carnival people’s torches sweep over you. Their foul 
smell fills your lungs. 

The blood pounds in your temples. 

You’re sure they’re going to find you. But you’re trapped now. 

There’s no way out. 

You hear someone shout in the distance. “Closing time!” And then you 
hear a bell start to chime ... 

... Midnight! 

“One, two, three,” Brad counts the chimes. 

You want to strangle him! 

“Four, five ...” 

Suddenly, the kiddie train starts to move. 

“Six ... seven ... eight...” 

You sit up and what you see is the biggest shock of this whole horrible 
night.... 


Turn to PAGE 70. 




129 

The Monster Blood has grown so big — now you can’t see over it or 
around it. 

“Run for your lives!” Patty screams. But reaching the door is impossible. 

The mound of green slime is bearing down on you. Fast! You stand frozen 
to the spot. Terrified. And then — just in time — you, Patty, and Brad leap to 
the side. And the Monster Blood slams into the wall with a crushing force — 
and plows right through it. 

You stare at the giant gaping hole in the wall. Quickly, the three of you 
jump through the opening. You are standing outside the main gate — where 
you came in! 

There’s a wide path of destruction across the field and the forest beyond. 
From somewhere, a clock chimes twelve times, sending a chill down your 
spine. And when you peer back at the carnival, it has disappeared. All that’s 
left is a spooky silver mist. 


THE END 



130 

You and your friends squeeze into the cannon. 

“Ouch! You’re sitting on my hand,” Brad whines. 

But you don’t have time to apologize. 

“Do you smell something ... burning?” you ask. 

BOOM! There’s a tremendous explosion. You fly through space. You are 
headed for a fence that encloses the carnival, and the field beyond. 

Will you make it out of the park? 

Go to PAGE 101. 




SUCKER!

You didn’t really think you could get out this easily, did you?

The fortune-teller said this number might save your life. But how? 

Then you see it. In the corner. A tall silver locker with the number 132 
painted in red. 

“In here,” you say, opening the door to the locker. You push Patty and 
Brad inside. 

As soon as you close the door, the locker begins to rattle and shake. 
You’re nearly blinded by a bright, white light. You hear a loud whooshing 
sound. And then all is silent. The door pops open — and you’re amazed at 
what you see. 

Turn to PAGE 21. 




133 

Those eyes behind the alligator snout — those beady eyes. You should 
have recognized them before. It’s Big Al. 

“Hey! You did a great job here,” he says warmly. “You’ve really got the 
stuff for the Carnival of Horrors.” 

“Uh, thanks,” you mumble. “But I really have to go home now.” 

“What’s the rush?” he asks, patting you on the shoulder. “Aren’t you 
having fun?” 

Fun? you think. Crushed between solid walls. Then attacked by a bulging¬ 
eyed monster. Fun? No. This isn’t fun. This is weird. 

“Uh, yeah. It’s been really great. But, um, I really do have to get home,” 
you stammer. “So if you’ll just take me to wherever Patty and Brad are — and 
show us the way out — we’ll be going.” 

“I’m afraid that isn’t possible,” Big Al says. “Just open the door and 
you’ll understand.” 


You have no choice. You have to open the door and go to PAGE 11 7 . 




134 

You’ve got to figure out what you weigh on Mars. Fast. But how? 

You’re about to give up when you notice a flashing sign. It reads: the 

GRAVITY ON MARS IS ALMOST 40 PERCENT OF WHAT IT IS ON EARTH. Okay, now you 
can figure it out. 

Multiply your real Earth weight by four. Now drop off the last digit. For 
example, if you weigh 90 pounds, 90 x 4 = 360. Dropping off the last digit, 
you get 36 for your weight on Mars. 

If you don’t want to do the math, you can leave it to luck. Just guess. 

If you think your Mars weight is 37 to 39, go to PAGE 53 . 

If you think your Mars weight is less than 37 or more than 39, go to PAGE 


22. 





135 

You open the door and climb a steep ramp that curves around and around. 
It’s cold and dark inside. Halfway up the ramp, you stop. There’s another 

sign: WARNING! — YOU MAY BE THE ONE TO SLIDE TO YOUR DOOM! 

You continue up the ramp. You finally make it to the top, and find 
yourself standing on a wide, dimly lit platform. A row of long, curving slides 
stretches out before you. The slides are numbered from one to ten. 

You think hard. The Doom Slide. You know you’ve heard about it before. 
But where? Where was it? 

And then you remember! It was in a GOOSEBUMPS book you read! One 
Day at HorrorLand. 

Now you know you’re in big trouble. Because you remember all about the 
Doom Slide from the book. You remember that if you pick the wrong slide, 
you’ll spend the rest of your life sliding and sliding — forever! 

Which number is the Doom Slide? Which one? 

If you remember which number slide is the Doom Slide (or if you have 
the book and can look it up), choose a slide that is not the Doom Slide. If 
you can’t remember, you’ll have to leave it to luck. Pick a number between 
1 - 10 . 

Pick slide 1,4, or 5, and go to PAGE 121 . 

Pick slide 2, 7, or 9, and go to PAGE 95 . 

Pick slide 3, 6, 8, or 10, and go to PAGE 68 .

GIVE YOURSELF 



THE KNIGHT IN 
SCREAMING ARMOR 



inmniT-inH 


Here’s a sneak peek! 















BEWARE!! 

DO NOT READ THIS BOOK FROM 
BEGINNING TO END! 

Prepare yourself to meet the Knight in Screaming Armor! 

Your cousins are coming to visit you from England. They’re bringing 
something with them. A little surprise ... 

It’s an old suit of armor from your uncle’s collection. It has a really cool 
battle-ax and a shield. And it has something else too — orders to destroy you! 

You see, there’s an ancient curse that was placed upon your family and the 
knight is here to deliver it! And that’s not all — a ghastly-looking gardener

“Pip-pip! Ta-ta! Jolly good! Tallyho and all that rot!” your dad exclaims. 

“Da-a-a-d!” you plead. “Pleeeeeeease!” 

“So sorry,” he apologizes in his best British accent. “We just want your 
cousins to feel quite at home now, don’t we? It’s not every day we have 
visitors from England. It’s been over a year since we’ve seen them. Jolly 
good! Ta-ta! Pip-pip!” your dad says again. 

“Yes,” your mom adds. “Your Uncle Will is giving lectures at several 
important American museums. So Kip and Abbey will be staying with us for 
a whole week. Isn’t that terrific?” 

You only half agree. Kip Saxton is your age. Sometimes he complains too 
much. But mostly, he’s a pretty cool kid. His fifteen-year-old sister is another 
story. “Abbey acts like she’s queen of the world,” you say. “She can be a 
royal pain!” 

“Oh, you’ll have fun,” your dad assures you. “Uncle Will says Kip and 
Abbey are bringing a big surprise with them!” 

“A surprise?” you ask. “What surprise?”

Before your dad can say another word about the surprise, the doorbell 
rings. 

“They’re here!” your mom calls from the front hall. She opens the door as 
the airport shuttle van pulls away. Your cousins are standing in the doorway. 
“You haven’t changed a bit!” your mom declares as she hugs Abbey and Kip. 

“I hope that’s not true,” you mutter. Your tall blond cousin is already 
staring past you and into the mirror behind you. “Hi,” you manage to say to 
her. 

Abbey primps her long golden curls before she answers. “Oh, hi,” she 
says as she pats her hair about a hundred times. 

“Still the same old Abbey,” you have to admit. 

“Forget her,” someone says, laughing. It’s Kip. “Can you give me a hand? 
We’ve got more stuff to bring in.” Your sandy-haired cousin moves back out 
onto the front step and points to two huge wooden crates. The crates are taller 
than your dad. 

“What the —?” you start to say. 

“Artifacts!” your dad chimes in. “Uncle Will is coming here next week to 
lecture at the Medieval Museum downtown. I told him we’d store some 
exhibits here until he arrives. But I never expected anything this big! These 
crates will have to go in the garage.” 

“What’s in the crates anyway?” you ask Kip.

“Two suits of armor,” Kip says. “That’s what’s in the crates. They’re 
really old. From the fifteenth century. We call one of them the Evil Knight. 

It’s been with the Saxton family forever. The other suit was Sir Edmund 
Saxton’s. He’s our great-great-great-great ... well, you get the picture.” 

The crates are on wheels. You, Kip, Abbey, and your dad pull them down 
the driveway to the garage behind your house. You notice a label on one of 
the crates. 

“Hey, look at this,” you cry. You read the label aloud: 

“Beware this Dark and Evil Knight 
Cursed still from long ago. 

Until a Good Knight fights for right 
This Knight brings misery and woe. 

That’s kind of spooky,” you add. 

“No! Don’t read that out loud,” Kip cautions too late. “It’s an evil curse 
on the whole Saxton family!” 

“A curse?” You laugh. “You don’t believe in curses, do you?” 

“Sure I do. And so should you if you know what’s good for you,” Kip 
whispers. “I guess you’ve never heard the tale.” 


Listen to the tale on PAGE 4. 




“The tale? What tale?” you ask. 



“The legend of the Curse of the Knight in Screaming Armor!” Kip 
answers. “Years ago an evil sorceress got angry at the King’s best knight, Sir 
Edmund Saxton. You know, our ancestor? He killed her favorite dragon, or 
something. Anyway, she put a curse on him — the Curse of the Knight in 
Screaming Armor! 

“She made a special suit of armor and sent it to him as a gift. The armor 
was haunted. It held the spirit of an evil knight. That night, horrible screams 
and cries were heard from Saxton castle. In the morning, Sir Edmund and all 
of his family had been killed!” 

Kip’s eyes grow wide as he goes on. “All of his family was dead except 
one son. He had been out hunting. Anyway, he kept the armor. He was too 
scared to throw it away!” 

The four of you arrive at the garage and your dad reaches down to open 
the door. 

“This is that armor. Family legend has it that one day it will wake up 
again. Thirsty for Saxton blood. Then it will destroy all that is good! Unless a 
brave and noble Saxton can defeat it. It has to be a member of the Saxton 
family.” 

“Ha!” you laugh. “I’m related to you, so I’m a Saxton. What’s an Evil 
Knight’s suit of armor going to do to me?”
